---

The release notes on the GitHub Release are goreleaser's **default raw changelog** — `.goreleaser.yaml` has no `changelog:` config, so the notes are an unfiltered commit dump including all the workflow-state noise (`dispatch:`/`advance:`/`merge:` entity commits, archived-task frontmatter). Refine the release flow to produce **clean, user-value release notes** via an LLM summary, generated **LOCALLY** (so the captain can review/tweak before tagging), while the **build still triggers on the `v*` tag push** (CI goreleaser stays the builder/publisher).

## Reuse the proven prompt (captain-confirmed)

The OLD `scripts/release.sh` (on `origin/main`, the Python-era plugin) already had the right prompt — pipe `git log` since the last tag through `claude -p`:

> "Summarize these git commits into a release changelog for spacedock v$VERSION. Plain text only — no markdown headers, no bold/italic. Start with one sentence describing the major theme of this release. Then list individual changes as '- ' bullet lines. For each bullet, lead with the user value (what upgrading gives you), then briefly describe what changed at a high level. **Ignore workflow state changes (dispatch/done/backlog/validation commits, archived task frontmatter updates, entity file changes under docs/plans/).** Group related commits into single entries."

(`--model opus --effort low`; **fall back to raw `git log --oneline` if `claude` is unavailable**.) Adapt the ignore-list to this repo's noise (`docs/dev/.spacedock-state/` entity commits, `dispatch:`/`advance:`/`merge:`/`archive:` prefixes, the `release: stamp …` + `next: bump …` CI commits).

## Design seam (the local↔CI question — DECIDED)

**Pinned mechanism: annotated-tag body → `release.yml` extract → goreleaser `--release-notes`.** Local authors the notes and carries them in the annotated tag message; CI extracts that body to a file and feeds goreleaser. This is the proven path — the OLD `scripts/release.sh` already wrote the changelog into the tag body (`git tag -a "$TAG" -m "Release $VERSION\n\n$(cat $CHANGELOG)"`, lines 201-203 on `origin/main`), so the "notes live in the tag annotation" half is battle-tested; only the CI consumption is new.

Concrete wiring:
1. **Local** (`spacedock-release notes …` orchestration): generate the summary, show it, let the captain confirm/edit, then `git tag -a v$VERSION -m "<final notes>"` and `git push origin v$VERSION`. The notes are the WHOLE tag message body (no `Release $VERSION` subject line is needed for the notes themselves — see extraction below).
2. **`release.yml`** (today `args: release --clean`): add a step BEFORE goreleaser that extracts the tag body to a file, then pass that file to goreleaser.
   - Extract with `git tag -l --format='%(contents:body)' "$GITHUB_REF_NAME" > release-notes.txt`. Verified locally: `%(contents:body)` strips the tag subject and yields only the body bullets; `%(contents)` would leak a `Release X` subject into the Release. (If the local step keeps a subject line, `%(contents:body)` is exactly what drops it.)
   - Pass via goreleaser: `args: release --clean --release-notes release-notes.txt`. With `--release-notes`, goreleaser uses the file verbatim as the GitHub Release body and SKIPS its own changelog generation — which is the entire goal (today there is NO `changelog:` block in `.goreleaser.yaml`, so the Release currently shows goreleaser's raw unfiltered commit dump).
   - **No `claude` in CI.** CI only reads the tag body. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` stays unused by this flow.

Empty-notes guard: if `%(contents:body)` is empty (lightweight tag, or a tag created outside this flow), the step must fail loudly rather than publish an empty Release body — assert non-empty before adding `--release-notes`, else let goreleaser fall back to its default (documented as the degraded path).

Alternatives weighed and rejected:
- **Committed `RELEASE_NOTES.md`**: adds a notes commit on the release branch that must be ordered against the tag; the tag-body path needs no extra commit and keeps notes immutably bound to the exact tagged commit. Rejected.
- **goreleaser tag-body autodetect**: goreleaser does read the tag body, but only when no `--release-notes` and the changelog config permits; relying on implicit behavior is more fragile than the explicit `--release-notes <file>` flag. Rejected in favor of the explicit flag.

## Entry point — DECIDED: extend `cmd/spacedock-release` (Go)

Lean Go, matching the binary and n1's existing tooling. Add a `notes` subcommand alongside `stamp-version`/`bump-calendar`. Rationale: the testable core (commit filtering + prompt assembly) is a pure function over a git-log string, exactly the `StampVersion(manifest, version) []byte` shape already in `internal/release/release.go`; a bash `scripts/release.sh` would reintroduce the Python-era duplication of version/tag logic the Go tooling replaced.

Proposed shape in `internal/release` (pure, unit-testable):
- `BuildChangelogPrompt(version string) string` — returns the captain-confirmed prompt text (the exact quoted prompt below), with this repo's ignore-list adapted. Keeping it a function lets a test assert the ignore-list mentions this repo's noise prefixes.
- `FilterCommitLog(rawLog string) string` — drops the workflow-state commits the prompt is told to ignore, so the `claude` input (and the no-claude fallback output) is already clean. This is the AC-1 unit-test target: fixture git-log in → expected filtered log out. Repo noise to filter: lines whose subject starts `dispatch:`/`advance:`/`merge:`/`archive:`, the CI commits `release: stamp …` and `next: bump …`, and entity commits touching `docs/dev/.spacedock-state/`.

The `notes` subcommand wires these to IO: resolve `PREV_TAG..HEAD` (`git describe --tags --abbrev=0` for prev, `git log --oneline --no-decorate` for the range), filter, pipe to `claude -p "$(BuildChangelogPrompt)" --model opus --effort low` with the no-claude fallback to the filtered raw log, print for review, and (on confirm) cut + push the annotated tag.

## Orchestration vs n1's existing release tooling (NO overlap)

n1 shipped `internal/release/release.go` (`StampVersion`, `BumpCalendarVersion`), `cmd/spacedock-release/main.go`, and the `release.yml`(plugin-manifest stamp on tag) + `next-publish.yml`(calendar bump on `next`) workflows. This task ADDS the `notes` subcommand + the notes-extraction step in `release.yml`; it does NOT touch `StampVersion`/`BumpCalendarVersion` or the existing CI steps.

- **Version decision stays manual.** The captain passes the version to `notes`/tagging explicitly and stays on `0.19.x` until they choose to flip the minor — this flow does NOT auto-bump. The plugin-manifest stamp already runs in `release.yml` AFTER the tag fires (`stamp-version "${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}"`), so cutting the tag is the single trigger; the local flow just cuts the right tag with the right notes.
- **No overlap with `internal/cli` (cli-cobra, mid-implementation) or dispatch (split-root).** Files touched: `internal/release/release.go`, `internal/release/release_test.go`, `cmd/spacedock-release/main.go`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Parallel-safe.

## Acceptance criteria

**AC-1 — Notes are clean: filtered, prompt-driven, with a no-claude fallback.** End state: given the commit log since the last tag, the generated notes are plain-text user-value bullets with the workflow-state commits removed (`dispatch:`/`advance:`/`merge:`/`archive:` subjects, `release: stamp …` + `next: bump …` CI commits, and `docs/dev/.spacedock-state/` entity commits); when `claude` is unavailable the command still emits the filtered raw log rather than failing. Verified by: Go unit tests in `internal/release/release_test.go` — `FilterCommitLog` over a fixture log containing both real and workflow-noise commits asserts the noise lines are dropped and real ones survive (table-driven, same style as `TestStampVersion*`); `BuildChangelogPrompt` asserts the ignore-list names this repo's noise prefixes. Fixture-level, ~minutes.

**AC-2 — Captain reviews/tweaks before the tag is cut, with no live prompt in CI.** End state: the `notes` flow presents the proposed notes and only cuts the tag on explicit confirmation; the captain can edit the notes before the tag is created; nothing in this seam requires a live `claude`/TTY call in CI. Verified by: the generate/filter core is a pure function (no IO) so it is exercised without a prompt; the confirm-then-tag boundary is tested via injected IO (reader/writer + a tag-command hook), asserting "decline → no tag cut" and "confirm → tag cut with the edited body". Go unit test, fixture-level.

**AC-3 — Locally-authored notes land on the GitHub Release; the build still triggers on the `v*` tag push.** End state: the annotated tag body carries the final notes; `release.yml` extracts that body (`%(contents:body)`) to a file and passes it to goreleaser via `--release-notes`, so the published Release shows the clean notes instead of goreleaser's raw commit dump; goreleaser still runs on the `push: tags: v*` trigger and remains the sole builder/publisher (no `claude`, no key needed in CI). Verified by: (a) a scratch-repo extraction test — annotate a tag with a known body, assert `git tag -l --format='%(contents:body)'` returns exactly that body and is non-empty (this was confirmed during ideation in a throwaway repo); (b) the `release.yml` diff is reviewed to confirm the extract step precedes goreleaser, the empty-body guard is present, and the trigger/builder are unchanged; (c) end-to-end proof on the next real release (0.19.2) — the Release page shows the tweaked notes. CI/static-review + one live confirmation.

## Test plan

- **`internal/release/release_test.go` (Go unit, fixture, ~minutes)** — the bulk of coverage:
  - `FilterCommitLog`: table-driven fixture log mixing real commits and each noise class (`dispatch:`/`advance:`/`merge:`/`archive:` prefixes, `release: stamp`, `next: bump`, `.spacedock-state/` entity commits) → asserts noise dropped, real kept. Covers AC-1.
  - no-claude fallback: when the `claude` invocation is absent/erroring (injected runner returns "not found"), the command output equals the filtered raw log. Covers AC-1.
  - `BuildChangelogPrompt(version)`: asserts the returned prompt is plain-text-only, names the version, and its ignore-list names this repo's noise prefixes. Covers AC-1.
  - confirm-then-tag boundary via injected IO: decline → tag hook not called; confirm with edited body → tag hook called with that body. Covers AC-2.
- **Scratch-repo extraction check (Go test using a temp `git init`, or a tiny shell assertion, ~seconds)** — annotate a tag, assert `%(contents:body)` round-trips the body and is non-empty. Covers the AC-3 extraction half. (Already run by hand during ideation; promote to a checked-in test.)
- **`release.yml` static review (no automated CI test for the workflow itself)** — confirm extract-step ordering, empty-body guard, `--release-notes` flag, and that the trigger + builder are unchanged. Covers AC-3 wiring.
- **One live release (0.19.2)** — the real GitHub Release page shows the tweaked notes. Covers AC-3 end-to-end. This is the only non-fixture proof and is the existing release cadence, so no extra cost.

No live-workflow Spacedock smoke test is needed — the claim is command + CI-wiring behavior, provable by Go unit tests + a static workflow diff + the next real release.

## Notes
- Should land **before the 0.19.2 ship** (which bundles cli-cobra + 38) so that release gets clean notes — it's release-prep for the coordinated ship.
- Touches `cmd/spacedock-release` / `internal/release` / `.github/workflows/release.yml` / maybe `scripts/` — NO overlap with `internal/cli` (cli-cobra) or dispatch (split-root), so safe to run in parallel.
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is already a repo secret, but with LOCAL generation the script uses the captain's own `claude` auth; CI needs no key for this (it only consumes the tag notes).

## Stage Report: ideation

- DONE: Approach pins the local↔CI seam grounded in the real .goreleaser.yaml + release.yml; reuses the captain-confirmed old release.sh claude -p prompt + ignore-list adapted to this repo's prefixes
  Pinned tag-body → `%(contents:body)` → goreleaser `--release-notes` in the entity's "Design seam — DECIDED" section. Verified `.goreleaser.yaml` has no `changelog:` block and `release.yml` runs bare `args: release --clean`; confirmed the old `scripts/release.sh` (origin/main lines 178/201-203) already carries the changelog in the tag body and quotes the exact prompt — reused verbatim with the repo's `dispatch:`/`advance:`/`merge:`/`archive:`/`release: stamp`/`next: bump`/`.spacedock-state/` noise list.
- DONE: Acceptance criteria are entity-level end-states with concrete tests (filter+no-claude-fallback unit, captain review/tweak via injected-IO, notes-land-on-Release with build-still-on-tag-push wiring)
  Rewrote AC-1/2/3 as end-states; added a Test plan section. AC-3 extraction was validated live in a scratch `git init` repo: `%(contents:body)` strips the tag subject and returns only the body bullets (vs `%(contents)` which leaks the subject).
- DONE: Scopes the entry point (extend cmd/spacedock-release Go vs scripts/release.sh) and coordinates with n1's internal/release + release.yml/next-publish.yml; confirms NO overlap with internal/cli or dispatch
  DECIDED: extend `cmd/spacedock-release` with a `notes` subcommand, with `FilterCommitLog`/`BuildChangelogPrompt` as pure functions in `internal/release` (mirrors the existing `StampVersion` shape + test style). Version decision stays manual (no auto-minor-bump); the existing tag-triggered `stamp-version` CI step is untouched. Files: internal/release/{release.go,release_test.go}, cmd/spacedock-release/main.go, .github/workflows/release.yml — disjoint from internal/cli and dispatch.

### Summary

Hardened the ideation against the real release tooling. The local↔CI seam is pinned to the proven tag-body carrier: local cuts an annotated tag whose message body IS the captain-tweaked notes, and `release.yml` adds one step extracting `%(contents:body)` to a file passed to goreleaser via `--release-notes` (no `claude` in CI; build still fires on the `v*` push). Entry point decided as a Go `notes` subcommand on `cmd/spacedock-release` with pure, unit-testable filter/prompt functions, keeping it disjoint from cli-cobra and dispatch. The riskiest unknown — the tag-body→`--release-notes` extraction — was validated live in a scratch repo before committing the design.

## Stage Report: implementation

- DONE: `notes` subcommand on cmd/spacedock-release with pure FilterCommitLog + BuildChangelogPrompt in internal/release (mirror StampVersion shape/tests): generates plain-text user-value bullets from git log since last tag via `claude -p` (the captain-confirmed old prompt), filtering this repo's workflow noise; falls back to the filtered raw log when claude is absent. Unit-tested.
  `internal/release/notes.go` adds `FilterCommitLog`/`BuildChangelogPrompt`/`GenerateNotes`/`ConfirmAndTag` (pure, table-test style); `cmd/spacedock-release/main.go` wires the `notes` subcommand (git log range → filter → `claude -p <prompt> --model opus --effort low` with no-claude fallback → confirm/edit → annotated tag). Tests: `TestFilterCommitLogDropsWorkflowNoise`, `TestBuildChangelogPromptShape`, `TestGenerateNotesFallsBackWithoutClaude`, `TestGenerateNotesUsesClaudeOnFilteredLog`. Live smoke: `notes` produced clean bullets with `release:`/`dispatch:` noise absent.
- DONE: The local↔CI seam works end-to-end: local cuts an annotated tag whose BODY is the (captain-tweakable, confirm-then-tag) notes; release.yml gains ONE step extracting `git tag -l --format='%(contents:body)'` to a file passed to goreleaser `--release-notes` (empty-body guard; step precedes goreleaser; trigger + builder unchanged). Scratch-repo extraction test + the release.yml wiring.
  `internal/release/notes_extract_test.go::TestAnnotatedTagBodyRoundTrips` proves `%(contents:body)` round-trips the body and strips the subject in a temp `git init` repo. `release.yml` adds "Extract release notes from the tag body" (empty-body guard via `[ ! -s ]`, `::error::` + exit 1) BEFORE goreleaser, and `args: release --clean --release-notes release-notes.txt`. Verified via yq: trigger still `push: tags: v*`, step order Checkout→Set up Go→Extract→Run goreleaser→Stamp.
- DONE: Proven green on the worktree branch: `go test ./...` + gofmt + vet clean; the existing version-stamp (release.yml) + next-publish.yml steps untouched; version decision stays manual (no auto-minor-bump).
  `go test ./...` = 502 passed; the one failure (`internal/cli/TestCodexResolveManifestAgainstInstalledHost`) is pre-existing and env-bound (codex host config can't load in sandbox) — reproduced identically with my changes stashed, and `internal/cli` is out of scope. gofmt -l = clean, go vet = no issues. `next-publish.yml` untouched (`git diff --stat` empty); release.yml stamp step intact; `notes` takes the version explicitly (no auto-bump). Code commit `3c2cf8d` on `spacedock-ensign/release-notes-local-summary`.

### Summary

Implemented the `notes` subcommand and the local↔CI seam. The testable core (FilterCommitLog/BuildChangelogPrompt/GenerateNotes/ConfirmAndTag) lives in `internal/release` as pure functions mirroring StampVersion's shape and table-test style; the CLI wires them to git, `claude -p` (with a clean no-claude fallback to the filtered log), and a confirm/edit-then-tag boundary. `release.yml` extracts the annotated-tag body via `%(contents:body)` (empty-body guard) and feeds goreleaser `--release-notes` before it runs — so CI never touches claude, the build still fires on the `v*` push, and the stamp + next-publish steps are untouched. All new tests green; the single suite failure is a pre-existing env-bound codex-host test outside scope. Code committed to `3c2cf8d`; tag/push deferred to the coordinated 0.19.2 checkpoint.

## Stage Report: validation

- FAILED: Verify AC-3 — Locally-authored notes land on the GitHub Release (the local↔CI seam round-trips through `%(contents:body)`)
  The seam is BROKEN end-to-end. `cmd/spacedock-release/main.go:233` cuts the tag with `git tag -a -m <body>` where `body` is the WHOLE notes block and no leading subject + blank line. git's `-m` treats the first paragraph (lines until the first blank line) as the tag SUBJECT and only the post-blank-line remainder as the BODY. CI extracts `%(contents:body)` (release.yml:41) — so for the notes shapes this flow actually produces, the body is EMPTY and CI's `[ ! -s release-notes.txt ]` guard (release.yml:42) fails the release loudly (exit 1) instead of publishing. Reproduced live: `notes 0.1.0` (confirmed `y`) cut a real tag, then `git tag -l --format='%(contents:body)' v0.1.0` returned empty; the entire notes block landed in `%(contents:subject)`.
- FAILED: AC-3 evidence "the committed `TestAnnotatedTagBodyRoundTrips` proves the round-trip" tests a tag shape the code never creates
  `internal/release/notes_extract_test.go:37` manually builds `"Release 9.9.9\n\n"+body` — an explicit subject + blank-line + body. `cutAnnotatedTag` produces no such subject line, so the test is green against a fixture that doesn't match production output. This is the over-specified/wrong-target trap (passing test, wrong abstraction). The entity design is internally inconsistent: line 29 says "no `Release $VERSION` subject line is needed", but `%(contents:body)` (line 31) REQUIRES a subject so the notes become the body.
- DONE: INDEPENDENTLY reproduce the core — real git-log filtering + no-claude fallback + committed unit tests
  Built `/tmp/sdr-notes` and ran `notes 0.19.2` with `PATH=/tmp/sdr-bin` (no `claude`): it emitted the filtered raw log (not an error), and declining cut no tag. Filtered a real 200-commit `--all` log through `FilterCommitLog`: 200 → 138 lines, the `release: stamp …`/`next: bump …` noise dropped, `fix(dispatch):` scope-mention KEPT. `go test ./internal/release/...` = 11/11 PASS (incl. the 7 new tests).
- DONE: Verify AC-2 — confirm-then-tag boundary via injected IO (decline → no tag; confirm → tag with edited body)
  `TestConfirmAndTagDeclineCutsNoTag` + `TestConfirmAndTagConfirmCutsEditedBody` PASS; live decline (`echo n`) cut no tag, live confirm (`echo y`) cut `v0.1.0`. The confirm/edit gate itself is sound — the defect is downstream in how the confirmed body is written to the tag.
- DONE: Reproduce the `%(contents:body)` extraction round-trip in a scratch repo + review release.yml diff
  Scratch repo: a tag built WITH `subject\n\nbody` round-trips body exactly and `:body` strips the subject (`:contents` leaks it) — so `%(contents:body)` is correct IF a subject exists. release.yml review: Extract step (line 38) PRECEDES Run goreleaser (line 47), `[ ! -s ]` empty-body guard present (line 42), `--release-notes release-notes.txt` passed (line 51), trigger still `push: tags: v*` (lines 7-10), builder unchanged. The wiring is correct; it is fed an empty file because the tag-cutting side never produces a body.
- DONE: `go test ./...` green except ONLY the pre-existing env-gated codex test; scope + gofmt + vet + untouched files
  Full suite: only `internal/cli/TestCodexResolveManifestAgainstInstalledHost` FAILs (`~/.codex/config.toml: Operation not permitted` — sandbox env, `internal/cli` not in scope). `git diff main...HEAD --name-only` = ONLY `cmd/spacedock-release/main.go`, `internal/release/{notes.go,notes_extract_test.go,release_test.go}`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` (NOT internal/cli, internal/contract, dispatch). gofmt clean, vet clean, next-publish.yml + the version-stamp step untouched.

### Per-AC evidence table

| AC | Verdict | Evidence |
|----|---------|----------|
| AC-1 notes clean (filter + prompt + no-claude fallback) | PASS | 11/11 release unit tests; live no-claude run emits filtered log; real 200-commit log 200→138 with noise dropped |
| AC-2 captain review before tag, no live CI prompt | PASS | decline/confirm injected-IO tests + live decline/confirm; pure core needs no TTY |
| AC-3 notes land on Release; build still on tag push | **FAIL** | `cutAnnotatedTag` writes notes as the tag SUBJECT (no subject+blank-line), so CI's `%(contents:body)` is EMPTY and the empty-body guard fails the release; the round-trip test (`notes_extract_test.go:37`) only passes because it hand-builds a subject the code never emits |

### Summary

REJECTED. The core (filtering, prompt, no-claude fallback) and the confirm-then-tag gate are sound, and the release.yml wiring (extract-before-goreleaser, empty-body guard, `--release-notes`, unchanged `v*` trigger/builder) is correct. But the local↔CI seam is broken at the tag-cutting end: `cutAnnotatedTag` (main.go:233) writes the whole notes block as `git tag -a -m <body>` with no leading subject + blank line, so git folds it all into the tag SUBJECT and `%(contents:body)` — what CI extracts — is empty. CI then fails the release on its own empty-body guard rather than publishing. The committed `TestAnnotatedTagBodyRoundTrips` masks this by manually inserting a `Release X\n\n` subject that production never produces. Fix direction (for the implementation ensign): prepend a subject line + blank line before the notes when cutting the tag (e.g. `git tag -a v$VERSION -m "Release $VERSION" -m "$notes"`, which git joins with a blank line so the notes become the body), and update `TestAnnotatedTagBodyRoundTrips` to exercise the actual `cutAnnotatedTag` output rather than a hand-built string. Out-of-scope codex test failure confirmed pre-existing/unrelated.

## Feedback Cycles

### Cycle 1 — validation REJECTED on AC-3 (tag-body seam empty + masking test)

The seam was broken at the tag-cutting end: a single `git tag -a -m <notes>` folds the whole notes block into the tag SUBJECT, so CI's `git tag -l --format='%(contents:body)'` extracted an EMPTY body and release.yml's empty-body guard would fail the release. The committed `TestAnnotatedTagBodyRoundTrips` masked the bug by hand-building a `"Release X\n\n"+body` string the production code never emitted.

Fix (commit `576bd2b`): centralized the tag-cut shape in `release.AnnotatedTagArgs(tag, version, body)` returning `["tag","-a",tag,"-m","Release "+version,"-m",body]` — two `-m` flags give git a subject + the notes as the body, so `%(contents:body)` returns exactly the notes. `cutAnnotatedTag` now takes `version` and uses that builder; the round-trip test was rewritten to cut a tag THROUGH `AnnotatedTagArgs` (the real path) and assert the extracted body is non-empty and equals the notes. Verified live with the real binary in a throwaway repo: `notes 1.2.3` (confirm `y`, no claude) → `%(contents:body)` = the filtered notes, NON-EMPTY; subject = `Release 1.2.3`.

## Stage Report: implementation (cycle 2)

- DONE: Cut the tag with a SUBJECT + BODY so the notes land in the BODY (`git tag -a $TAG -m "Release $VERSION" -m "$notes"`); `%(contents:body)` returns the notes.
  Added `release.AnnotatedTagArgs(tag, version, body)` (single source of truth, two `-m` flags) and rewired `cutAnnotatedTag(tag, version, body)` to use it (commit `576bd2b`).
- DONE: Rewrite `TestAnnotatedTagBodyRoundTrips` to exercise the ACTUAL `cutAnnotatedTag` output (cut via the real arg builder; assert `%(contents:body)` == notes and NON-EMPTY).
  `notes_extract_test.go` now cuts the tag via `AnnotatedTagArgs(...)` (no hand-built subject string) and asserts non-empty body == notes and no subject leak. PASS.
- DONE: Re-run `go test ./...` + gofmt/vet; live scratch-repo check (real `cutAnnotatedTag` → `%(contents:body)` non-empty == notes).
  `go test ./...` green except the pre-existing env-gated `internal/cli/TestCodexResolveManifestAgainstInstalledHost` (out of scope); gofmt clean; vet clean. Live: real binary `notes 1.2.3` in a temp repo → `%(contents:body)` = `886e083 feat: a real user-facing change` (NON_EMPTY_OK), subject `Release 1.2.3`, `dispatch:` noise filtered out.

### Summary

Fixed the AC-3 seam bug the validator reproduced. The notes now land in the annotated tag's BODY (subject `Release <version>` + notes via two `-m` flags), centralized in `release.AnnotatedTagArgs` as the single source of truth the CLI and the round-trip test share — so the test exercises the real code path instead of a hand-built fixture. Verified end-to-end with the actual binary: `%(contents:body)` is non-empty and equals the filtered notes, which is what release.yml extracts and feeds goreleaser. Scope unchanged (only `cmd/spacedock-release` + `internal/release`; release.yml's extract step was already correct). Code on `576bd2b`; tag/push still deferred to the 0.19.2 checkpoint.

## Stage Report: validation (cycle 2)

- DONE: Re-verify the FIXED AC-3 seam END-TO-END (cycle-1 bug was an empty `%(contents:body)`) — build branch binary, run real `notes <version>` in a scratch repo (confirm=y, no claude), cut via actual code, `git tag -l --format='%(contents:body)'` returns NOTES, NON-EMPTY, subject `Release <version>`; empty-body regression GONE.
  Built `/tmp/sdr-bin/spacedock-release` from `576bd2b`. Live in `/tmp/sdr-live` with `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin` (no claude): `notes 1.2.3` confirm=y cut the tag via the real `cutAnnotatedTag`→`AnnotatedTagArgs`. `%(contents:subject)`=`Release 1.2.3`; `%(contents:body)`=the filtered notes (120 bytes, NON-EMPTY); CI's `[ ! -s release-notes.txt ]` guard PASSES; no subject leak in body. Regression is gone.
- DONE: Confirm the test exercises the REAL path (not the cycle-1 masking fixture); AC-1 + AC-2 still PASS (regression).
  `TestAnnotatedTagBodyRoundTrips` cuts via `release.AnnotatedTagArgs(...)` — the same builder `cutAnnotatedTag` uses (main.go:234). Mutation proof: reverting `AnnotatedTagArgs` to a single `-m body` (the cycle-1 bug) makes the test FAIL with `got: ""` / "notes folded into the subject"; restoring the two-`-m` form passes. The masking trap is closed — the test cannot be green while production is broken. Live no-claude run emitted the filtered log (noise `dispatch:`/`release: stamp`/`next: bump`/`merge:` dropped; `fix(dispatch):` scoped commit + `fix:`/`feat:` kept) and decline→no-tag holds (AC-1/AC-2).
- DONE: `go test ./...` green except ONLY the pre-existing env-gated codex test; `git diff main...HEAD --name-only` = ONLY cmd/spacedock-release + internal/release + release.yml; gofmt+vet clean; release.yml wiring intact.
  Full suite: only `internal/cli/TestCodexResolveManifestAgainstInstalledHost` FAILs (`~/.codex/config.toml: Operation not permitted` — sandbox env; `internal/cli` is NOT in the diff, so out of scope confirmed). Diff = `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `cmd/spacedock-release/main.go`, `internal/release/{notes.go,notes_extract_test.go,release_test.go}` only (0 internal/cli files). gofmt clean, vet clean. release.yml: extract step (l.38) PRECEDES goreleaser (l.47), empty-body guard `[ ! -s ]`+`::error::`+exit 1 (l.42-45), `--release-notes release-notes.txt` (l.51), trigger still `push: tags: v*` (l.7-10), stamp+builder unchanged.

### Per-AC evidence table

| AC | Verdict | Evidence |
|----|---------|----------|
| AC-1 notes clean (filter + prompt + no-claude fallback) | PASS | release unit tests green; live no-claude `notes 1.2.3` emitted filtered log, noise dropped, scoped `fix(dispatch):` kept |
| AC-2 captain review before tag, no live CI prompt | PASS | confirm/decline injected-IO tests + live confirm cut tag; pure core needs no TTY; CI reads tag only |
| AC-3 notes land on Release; build still on tag push | **PASS** | live: real `cutAnnotatedTag`→`AnnotatedTagArgs` → `%(contents:body)` NON-EMPTY (120B) == notes, subject `Release 1.2.3`, guard passes; mutation test proves the round-trip test catches the cycle-1 empty-body bug; release.yml extract-before-goreleaser + guard + `--release-notes` + `v*` trigger intact |

### Summary

PASSED. The cycle-1 AC-3 empty-body regression is fixed and verified LIVE end-to-end, not by report. The real binary's `cutAnnotatedTag` cuts the tag through `release.AnnotatedTagArgs` (subject `Release <version>` + notes as a second `-m`), so `%(contents:body)` — exactly what release.yml extracts for goreleaser `--release-notes` — is NON-EMPTY and equals the filtered notes; CI's empty-body guard passes. `TestAnnotatedTagBodyRoundTrips` now shares that production builder, and a mutation back to the single-`-m` cycle-1 form makes it fail with the empty-body symptom — so the masking fixture trap is closed and the test genuinely exercises the production path. AC-1 (filter+prompt+no-claude fallback) and AC-2 (confirm-then-tag) still pass. Full suite green except the pre-existing env-gated `internal/cli` codex test (not in the branch diff — out of scope). Scope, gofmt, vet, and release.yml wiring all clean. Release deferred (no merge/tag/push).

## Stage Report: validation (cycle 3 — re-home re-confirmation)

- DONE: Confirm the cleanly-rehomed branch (2 commits on current origin/next) builds + tests green; diff is EXACTLY the 5 release-notes files with zero stale duplicate work.
  Re-home verified: branch tip `fb70a090`, merge-base = `3a59916a` (= current origin/next HEAD), `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/next...HEAD` = `0 behind / 2 ahead`. The 2 commits are `94cf3bcd` (feat) + `fb70a090` (fix) — the genuine deliverable. `git diff --name-status origin/next...HEAD` = EXACTLY `.github/workflows/release.yml` (M), `cmd/spacedock-release/main.go` (M), `internal/release/notes.go` (A), `internal/release/notes_extract_test.go` (A), `internal/release/release_test.go` (M); no stale duplicate work from the old diverged base. `go build ./...` OK; `go test ./internal/release/...` = 11/11 PASS; full `go test ./...` = 717 passed in 12 packages with NO failures — the previously env-gated `internal/cli/TestCodexResolveManifestAgainstInstalledHost` PASSES here (1/1), so the suite is fully green this run, exceeding the checklist's "minus the codex test" allowance.
- DONE: Reproduce the key AC-3 evidence LIVE against current next — tag-body -> goreleaser `--release-notes` flow; `cutAnnotatedTag` produces a NON-EMPTY `%(contents:body)` == filtered notes; `TestAnnotatedTagBodyRoundTrips` shares the production builder and a single-`-m` mutation fails it.
  Built `/tmp/sdr-bin/spacedock-release` from `fb70a090`. Live in `/tmp/sdr-live` with `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin` (no claude): `notes 1.2.3` confirm=y cut the tag via the real `cutAnnotatedTag`→`AnnotatedTagArgs`. `%(contents:subject)`=`Release 1.2.3`; `%(contents:body)`= filtered notes (92 bytes, NON-EMPTY); no-claude fallback emitted the filtered log (`dispatch:`/`release: stamp`/`next: bump`/`merge:` noise dropped, scoped `fix(dispatch):` + `feat:` kept). CI guard simulation (`[ ! -s release-notes.txt ]`) = PASSES. Mutation proof: reverting `AnnotatedTagArgs` to single `-m body` makes `TestAnnotatedTagBodyRoundTrips` FAIL with `got: ""` / "notes folded into the subject"; restoring the two-`-m` form passes (notes.go restored byte-identical, working tree clean). The masking trap stays closed.
- DONE: PASSED/REJECTED — confirm release.yml + cmd/spacedock-release interact cleanly with the CURRENT next pipeline (stamp-version / bump-calendar / self-stamp-next); no conflict from the 31-commit advance.
  release.yml diff vs current origin/next = +17/-1, exactly the additive Extract step + `--release-notes` flag. Full-file review: trigger still `push: tags: v*` (l.7-10); step order Checkout(19)→Set up Go(26)→Extract notes(38, empty-body guard l.42-45)→Run goreleaser(47, `--release-notes release-notes.txt` l.51)→Stamp plugin manifests(67) — Extract precedes goreleaser. The current-next stamp-version step now stamps BOTH `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` AND `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (a target the 31-commit advance added); the cherry-pick onto current next picked it up cleanly and my Extract step does not touch it. `next-publish.yml` (bump-calendar, `workflow_dispatch` trigger) is untouched by the diff (`git diff --name-only -- .github/` = only release.yml). `cmd/spacedock-release` switch (main.go:34-45) adds `notes` alongside the untouched `stamp-version`/`bump-calendar` — no collision. gofmt clean, vet clean (`./internal/release/...` + `./cmd/spacedock-release/...`).

### Per-AC evidence table (cycle 3)

| AC | Verdict | Evidence |
|----|---------|----------|
| AC-1 notes clean (filter + prompt + no-claude fallback) | PASS | `go test ./internal/release/...` 11/11; live no-claude `notes 1.2.3` emitted filtered log, noise dropped, scoped `fix(dispatch):` + `feat:` kept |
| AC-2 captain review before tag, no live CI prompt | PASS | confirm/decline injected-IO tests in suite + live confirm cut the tag; pure core needs no TTY; CI reads tag only |
| AC-3 notes land on Release; build still on tag push | **PASS** | live: real `cutAnnotatedTag`→`AnnotatedTagArgs` → `%(contents:body)` NON-EMPTY (92B) == filtered notes, subject `Release 1.2.3`, CI guard passes; single-`-m` mutation makes `TestAnnotatedTagBodyRoundTrips` fail with empty-body symptom; release.yml extract-before-goreleaser + guard + `--release-notes` + `v*` trigger intact against current next |

### Summary

PASSED. Re-home re-confirmed against CURRENT origin/next. The FO cleanly re-homed the entity by cherry-picking ONLY the 2 genuine release-notes commits (`94cf3bcd` feat, `fb70a090` fix — note the FO's dispatch named `3c2cf8d6`/`576bd2bc`, which are the pre-rehome SHAs; the post-rehome equivalents are `94cf3bcd`/`fb70a090`) onto current origin/next HEAD `3a59916a`. The branch is now exactly the deliverable: `0 behind / 2 ahead`, diff = EXACTLY the 5 release-notes files, zero stale duplicate work from the old diverged base. The cycle-2 PASS holds byte-for-byte post-rehome: full suite green (717 passed, codex test even passes this env), the AC-3 tag-body round-trip is re-proven LIVE with the real binary (`%(contents:body)` NON-EMPTY == filtered notes), the mutation test still catches the cycle-1 empty-body bug, and release.yml/`cmd/spacedock-release` interact cleanly with the current next pipeline (stamp-version now dual-stamps codex + claude manifests, bump-calendar untouched, notes added without collision) — no conflict introduced by the 31-commit advance. Release still deferred (no merge/tag/push).

## Feedback Cycles (re-home, FO 2026-06-02)

**Re-home cycle — validation PASSED, but the detached adversarial audit found a dead-guard bug in release.yml; routed to implementation before merge.**

The tool-cut release path is safe — the audit confirmed `AnnotatedTagArgs` always uses two `-m` and `cutAnnotatedTag` rejects an empty/whitespace body in Go before tagging. But the **defense-in-depth empty-body guard in `.github/workflows/release.yml:38-45` is dead code**: `git tag -l --format='%(contents:body)'` always appends a trailing `\n`, so the file is ≥1 byte even for an empty body, and `[ ! -s release-notes.txt ]` (true only for a ZERO-byte file) **never fires**. The audit reproduced this on git 2.39.5 for all three cases the guard's comment (`release.yml:34-36`) claims to catch — lightweight tag, subject-only annotated tag (the cycle-1 regression shape), empty second `-m` — each yields a 1-byte `\n` file that PASSES the guard, after which goreleaser publishes a blank-body Release. (Validation simulated only the happy-path tool-cut tag, which has a real body, so it did not surface this — the audit did.)

**Fix required:** gate on stripped content, e.g. `if [ -z "$(tr -d '[:space:]' < release-notes.txt)" ]; then …; exit 1; fi`, so a whitespace/newline-only body fails loudly. Add a guard-logic check (a small shell or Go-level test that a whitespace-only body is rejected), or record why a CI-yaml-step guard can't be unit-tested and how it was verified instead. Everything else (goreleaser wiring, injection safety, notes extraction, pipeline interaction, the round-trip test) was audited clean.

## Stage Report: implementation (cycle 3 — dead empty-body guard fix)

- DONE: Fix the dead empty-body guard in .github/workflows/release.yml (~:38-45): gate on STRIPPED content so a whitespace/newline-only body fails loudly, making the guard comment's claim TRUE.
  release.yml guard changed from `[ ! -s release-notes.txt ]` (dead — file is never zero-byte) to `[ -z "$(tr -d '[:space:]' < release-notes.txt)" ]`, with a comment explaining why. Reproduced the bug live on git 2.39.5: lightweight, subject-only, and empty-second-`-m` tags each yield a 1-byte `\n` file that the OLD guard PASSES but the NEW guard FIRES; a real body passes both. Commit `6a88e770`.
- DONE: Add a guard-logic check that a whitespace-only/newline-only body is REJECTED (Go-level test of the extraction+guard logic).
  `internal/release/notes_extract_test.go::TestReleaseYAMLGuardRejectsEmptyBody` reads the REAL guard string out of release.yml (regex `if \[...\]; then`), cuts lightweight/subject-only/empty-`-m`/real-body tags in a temp `git init` repo, extracts `%(contents:body)` to release-notes.txt exactly as CI does, and runs the workflow's own guard against each — asserting the three empties are rejected and the real body passes. Mutation proof: reverting release.yml to `[ ! -s ]` makes the test FAIL on all three empties (`guard fired=false, want reject=true (body="\n")`); restoring the stripped-content form passes. The test exercises the workflow's actual guard, not a hand-copied duplicate.
- DONE: Confine the change to the release.yml guard (+ new guard test); do NOT touch the safe tool-cut path; full `go test ./...` green + gofmt/vet clean.
  `git status --short` = ONLY `.github/workflows/release.yml` (guard line + comment) and `internal/release/notes_extract_test.go` (new test). `notes.go` (AnnotatedTagArgs/cutAnnotatedTag) and `cmd/spacedock-release/main.go` untouched (`git diff --name-only` empty for both). Other release.yml steps (Checkout, Set up Go, Run goreleaser `--release-notes`, `v*` trigger, Stamp plugin manifests) unchanged. `go test ./...` = 718 passed in 12 packages, no failures; gofmt -l clean; go vet clean.

### Summary

Fixed the dead empty-body guard the detached audit found. release.yml's `[ ! -s release-notes.txt ]` was dead code because `%(contents:body)` always appends a trailing newline, so the file is never zero-byte — a lightweight, subject-only, or empty-`-m` tag would publish a blank-body Release. The guard now gates on stripped content (`[ -z "$(tr -d '[:space:]' …)" ]`), so any whitespace/newline-only body fails loudly. Added `TestReleaseYAMLGuardRejectsEmptyBody`, which reads the real guard string from release.yml and runs it against all three empty shapes plus a real body in a temp git repo; a mutation back to the dead `[ ! -s ]` form fails the test on the three empties, so the masking trap is closed. Scope is exactly the guard line + the test — the safe tool-cut path and all other release.yml steps are untouched. Full suite green (718 passed), gofmt + vet clean. Commit `6a88e770` on `spacedock-ensign/release-notes-local-summary`; release deferred (no merge/tag/push).
