Follow-up to the README value-measuring-AC rule (landed a5e8c01e in docs/dev/README.md). That edit forces SHAPING to produce a value-measuring AC; these two edits make the FO GATE re-anchor on it — closing the begin-with-the-end loop (named at dispatch, never verified at the gate). The merge-guard miss: a well-formed but means-framed AC-3 ("the prose updates to the one-verb flow") passed the gate while the entity's end-value — a leaner contract — went unmet (+8 lines).

DECIDE FIRST (open): do these land in the FO operating contract (skills/first-officer/references/first-officer-shared-core.md — applies to EVERY workflow the FO runs) or in the shipped dev-template scaffolding (the dev-shape contract for commissioned dev workflows)? The README rule went into the per-workflow process doc; the gate machinery is FO-contract. The value-AC concept may belong at the universal FO-contract level, or be a dev-shape concern. Pick the layer + record a one-line rationale BEFORE editing. Contract files are scaffolding → dispatched worker, contractlint-guarded.

## Edits (from the begin-with-the-end design workflow)

EDIT A — AC coverage cross-check ("## Completion and Gates" → "AC coverage cross-check" paragraph, ~line 106): append one clause — "Re-anchor on the end: if an AC asserts only its mechanism (the prose updated, the verb shipped, the section was rewritten), it is satisfied only when the value-measuring AC that mechanism serves is also satisfied — a mechanism whose stated end value regressed (e.g. a leaner-contract entity whose contract GREW) is a REJECT, not a pass." Reuses the cross-check the FO already runs; the deterministic trigger is the namable mechanism-verb shape (matches the README banned-form list); the harder "is it the RIGHT value" escalates to the captain.

EDIT B — Working Principles / FO posture (~line 240): give "Name the end value before starting" its GATE half — "Name the end value before starting, verify it was delivered at the gate" + "The naming is dispatch-side; the matching verification is the AC cross-check's end re-anchor (see Completion and Gates). Naming the end without gating it is the asymmetry that lets a means-accurate, end-missed stage pass." A cross-pointer, not a copy. SKILL.md needs no edit (correctly a posture seed).

## Acceptance criteria
- **AC-1** — the fo-vs-dev-template layer is DECIDED and recorded (one-line rationale) before any contract edit.
- **AC-2** — EDIT A + EDIT B land in the chosen layer; a stage that presents a mechanism-only AC whose served end-value regressed is REJECTED at the gate. Verified by exercising the gate decision on a fixture (a means-only-AC + regressed-value entity → REJECT), NOT a prose-grep over the contract.
- **AC-3** — net resident-contract token delta is +5 lines or less (this fix must not bloat the contract it protects); the delta is reported in the stage report.

Cross-ref: README rule a5e8c01e (the shaping half, already landed); z2 fo-self-evidence-bar (adjacent but DISTINCT — FALSE evidence on the FO's own decision; do NOT merge into it); trim-dispatch-adapter-prose (contract-hygiene track).
