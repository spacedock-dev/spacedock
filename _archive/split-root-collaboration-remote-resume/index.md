Phase B of the split-root model (Phase A = boot surfacing + absolute path + commission rule +
single-root test, entity `split-root-ergonomics-and-remote-model`). The captain chose the
**same-repo orphan-branch model first** (separate-repo + `state-remote:` is a deferred possibility,
NOT this entity). This entity makes split-root **multi-host collaborative** with explicit semantics.

Depends on Phase A: the boot `state_backend` + `entity_dir_present` fields are the diagnostic seam the
FO sanity-check (journey 3) hangs off. The Phase-A ideation body (B4/B5 sections, the resume spike)
is the starting design; this entity supersedes its remote-shape recommendation toward the
captain-directed orphan-branch model.

## The model (captain-directed): same-repo orphan branch

State lives on an **orphan branch in the SAME repo** (no second repo, no second remote). State
commits land on the orphan branch (pushed to the main `origin`); the code branch never sees them
(zero churn). The state checkout is a linked worktree of the main repo at the gitignored `state:` path.

## Three journeys to make crisp (captain)

**Journey 1 — Commission a split-root workflow (orphan-branch, same repo).**
Commission writes `state: <path>` (+ a workflow-slug-derived `state-branch`), creates the orphan
branch, and checks it out at the state path as a linked worktree (gitignored on the code branch), so a
freshly-commissioned split workflow is immediately usable.

**Journey 2 — Commission an inline workflow.**
Commission writes the explicit inline sentinel (`state: $inline`) OR omits `state:` (empty → inline,
backward-compat). Entities live beside the README on the same branch.

**Journey 3 — Clone a shape-(1) repo and resume.**
A fresh `git clone` brings the code branch; the state worktree is absent (orphan branch not checked
out). The FO sanity-checks at boot (split-root declared + `entity_dir_present: false` from Phase A) →
HALTS dispatch, reports "state not initialized," and runs/prompts `spacedock state init`, which
fetches the orphan branch and checks it out at the state path. Then work proceeds.

## Scope / design points (ideation hardens — design-first, captain-gated)

**B1 — Explicit `state:` semantics + backward-compat (captain point 2).**
- empty/absent `state:` → **inline** (single-root), backward-compatible default (unchanged).
- `state: $inline` (or a finalized non-colliding sentinel) → **explicit inline**.
- `state: <relative-path>` → **split-root**.
- `resolveRoots`/`splitRootStateCheckout` must treat the inline sentinel as inline (not a path to
  join). Rationale: disambiguate intentional-inline from split-root-with-missing-state, so a missing
  dir on a path-valued `state:` is unambiguously init-needed (journey 3), not maybe-inline.

**B2 — Workflow-specific `state-branch` (captain point 1).**
- Default branch name derives from the workflow slug: `spacedock-state/<workflow-slug>` (matches the
  existing `spacedock-state/dev`). Optional README `state-branch:` override. Multiple workflows in one
  repo → distinct, non-colliding state branches. Remote = the main repo's `origin`.

**B3 — Commission scaffolding (journeys 1 & 2).**
- Split: write `state:` + derived `state-branch`, create the orphan branch, check it out at the state
  path as a linked worktree (gitignored). Inline: write `$inline` (or omit). Freshly-commissioned
  split workflow immediately usable.

**B4 — `spacedock state init` (journey 3 resume).**
- Reads `state:`/`state-branch` from the README. If split-root + state path absent:
  `git fetch origin <state-branch>` + `git worktree add <state-path> <state-branch>`. Idempotent
  (fetch/no-op if present). Documented manual one-liner fallback.

**B5 — FO sanity-check gate (journey 3, captain point 3).**
- FO startup: if split-root declared AND `entity_dir_present: false` → HALT dispatch, report, run/
  prompt `spacedock state init` before proceeding. A FO-contract addition keyed on the Phase-A boot
  field.

**B6 — Multi-writer sync discipline: push / pull --rebase (captain point 3).**
- The state branch is shared via `origin`. FO/ensigns MUST push state commits after committing, and
  `git pull --rebase` when relying on possibly-stale state / integrating concurrent writers. A new
  FO + ensign contract addition extending the path-scoped state-commit rule. Ideation designs the
  minimal sync points (boot? pre-dispatch? on push-rejection?) and how it composes with the existing
  path-scoped-commit concurrency rule.

## Acceptance criteria (provisional — ideation hardens)

**AC-1 — `state:` modes are explicit.** `$inline` parses as inline; empty `state:` defaults to inline
(backward-compat); a relative path → split-root. Verified by a status-parser test over all three.

**AC-2 — `state-branch` defaults to a workflow-slug-specific name** (`spacedock-state/<slug>`),
overridable. Verified by a test; reproducible on this workflow.

**AC-3 — Commission scaffolds both journeys.** A split commission yields a usable orphan-branch state
worktree; an inline commission yields beside-the-README entities. Verified by commission e2e/tests.

**AC-4 — `spacedock state init` resumes a cloned shape-(1) repo.** Fresh main clone → `state init` →
`spacedock status` renders the entities. Verified by an e2e mirroring the Phase-A resume spike.

**AC-5 — FO sanity-check blocks on uninitialized state and resumes after init.** Verified by the FO
contract + a behavioral check on the boot-field gate (split-root + entity_dir_present:false → halt).

**AC-6 — Push/pull--rebase sync discipline is contractual and exercised.** A 2-writer sync e2e: host A
commits+pushes a state change, host B `pull --rebase` sees it; the FO/ensign contracts carry the rule.

## Out of scope
- Separate-repo + `state-remote:` shape (deferred possibility; not this entity).
- Mods / PR-merge behavior; a full lock-based concurrency model beyond path-scoped-commit + pull--rebase.

## Notes — design-first, captain-gated
Genuine architecture (orphan-branch worktree mechanics, the `$inline` sentinel token, the sync-point
design, the FO halt-gate). The FO will bring the ideation design to the captain rather than
auto-approving, and ideation should propose its own internal sequencing (e.g. B1/B2 parser semantics
first, then B3/B4 commission+init, then B5/B6 FO/ensign contract). Reference: the Phase-A entity's
ideation design + resume spike, docs/specs/state-behavior-extension.md, docs/roadmap/bootstrap-roadmap.md.

# Ideation design (2026-05-31) — decision-ready, captain-gated

This design is decision-ready: each part names a recommendation, gives tradeoffs, and a concrete
reproducible proof at the right altitude. The model is FIXED by the captain (same-repo
**orphan-branch** state on the main `origin`; separate-repo + `state-remote:` is explicitly DEFERRED).
The three riskiest unknowns were SPIKED end-to-end before finalizing — results in §Spike. This entity
supersedes Phase A's "separate-repo + declared remote (shape a)" recommendation toward shape (c)
orphan-branch, which the captain selected.

## Grounded current state (verified 2026-05-31)

- **`state:` is read at THREE sites, all treating non-empty as a path to join.** (1) `resolveRoots`
  (status/roots.go:55-67) diverges `entityDir = definitionDir/<state>`; (2) `splitRootStateCheckout`
  (dispatch/helpers.go:127-135) returns `workflowDir/<state>` for the state-commit guidance; (3)
  `discoverWorkflows` (status/handlers.go:378) prunes `definitionDir/<state>` from the workflow scan.
  All three reject absolute / `..`-escaping values. **A `$inline` sentinel must be recognized at all
  three** or one site joins a literal `…/$inline` path — the strongest argument for a single shared
  helper (B1).
- **Phase A already ships the B5 seam.** The Phase-A worktree (`internal/status/boot.go`,
  `json_commands.go`) emits boot keys `state_backend` (`split-root`|`single-root`),
  `definition_dir`, `entity_dir`, `entity_dir_present` (string `"true"`/`"false"`), appended after
  `team_state` (`bootJSONKeys`, json_boot_test.go:20). `state_backend` is derived from
  `entityDir != definitionDir`; `entity_dir_present` is an `os.Stat(entityDir).IsDir()`. **B5's
  halt-gate keys directly off `state_backend == "split-root" && entity_dir_present == "false"`** with
  no new boot field. Design B against these planned fields; do not duplicate them.
- **The existing state checkout is structurally shape (a), NOT (c).** `docs/dev/.spacedock-state`
  TODAY is an *independent* repo (own `.git` with `hooks/`/`info/`, branch `spacedock-state/dev`, NO
  remote). The orphan-branch model wants it to be a *linked worktree of the main repo* on an orphan
  branch pushed to main `origin`. That is a structural shift; migrating THIS workflow's existing
  checkout is a one-time operational step (see §Migration), not part of the shipped feature surface.

## B1 — `$inline` sentinel + backward-compat, via ONE shared resolver

**Recommendation: a single shared classifier `classifyState(stateValue) → (mode, relPath, err)`** in
`internal/status` (the package `dispatch` already imports), consumed by all three read sites. Three
modes:
- `""` (empty/absent) → **inline** (single-root), unchanged backward-compat default.
- `"$inline"` (exact, after `TrimSpace`) → **explicit inline** — treated identically to empty for
  root resolution (NOT joined as a path; `entityDir == definitionDir`).
- any other value → **split-root**: validate (reject absolute, reject `..`-escape as today), return
  the cleaned relative path to join.

**Why a sentinel at all (not just empty).** Disambiguates *intentional inline* from
*split-root-with-missing-state*. Once shape-(1) workflows always carry a path-valued `state:`, a
missing dir on a path-valued `state:` is **unambiguously init-needed** (journey 3), never
maybe-inline. `$inline` lets commission stamp inline workflows explicitly so the absence of `state:`
keeps meaning legacy-default rather than overloading "needs init."

**Why `$inline` is non-colliding.** `state:` is a relative path; `$` is not a legal leading char for
the v0 child-checkout paths (which are `.spacedock-state`-style names), and the existing validator
already rejects absolute and `..` paths, so `$inline` cannot collide with a real checkout name. The
`$` prefix is a recognizable sentinel convention. (Open micro-decision for the captain: `$inline`
vs `@inline` vs a bareword `inline`. RECOMMEND `$inline` per the captain's suggestion — the `$`
sigil reads as "not a path" at a glance and is the lowest collision risk.)

**Parser behavior (concrete).** `classifyState` runs after `strings.TrimSpace`. `resolveRoots`,
`splitRootStateCheckout`, and `discoverWorkflows`'s prune all call it; on `inline`/`explicit-inline`
they keep `entityDir == definitionDir` / return `""` / skip the prune respectively. The existing
absolute/`..` rejection moves INTO the classifier so the three sites share one validation.

**Proof altitude (AC-1).** Go unit tests on the status parser over all three modes: `$inline` →
inline (`entityDir == definitionDir`, `splitRootStateCheckout == ""`), empty → inline (unchanged),
a relative path → split-root (`entityDir == definitionDir/<path>`). Plus a negative: `$inline` is NOT
joined as a literal path at any of the three sites (no `…/$inline` on disk-path output). Correct
altitude: parser/command behavior is a Go unit claim.

## B2 — Workflow-slug `state-branch` default

**Recommendation: default `state-branch = spacedock-state/<workflow-slug>`**, overridable by an
optional README `state-branch:` field. The slug is the workflow's identifying token (matches the
existing `spacedock-state/dev` for the `docs/dev` workflow). Multiple workflows in one repo → distinct
non-colliding orphan branches on the same main `origin`. The remote is ALWAYS the main repo's
`origin` (no `state-remote:` in this entity — deferred).

**Slug derivation.** RECOMMEND deriving the slug from the workflow dir's basename
(`filepath.Base(workflowDir)` → `dev` for `docs/dev`), which reproduces the existing
`spacedock-state/dev` exactly and needs no new frontmatter. (Alternative: a README `slug:`/`id`
field; rejected as heavier — basename already yields the shipped name.) An explicit README
`state-branch:` always wins when present.

**Proof altitude (AC-2).** A Go unit test on the branch-name derivation: basename `dev` →
`spacedock-state/dev`; an overriding `state-branch:` field is honored verbatim. Reproducible on THIS
workflow (its `docs/dev/README.md` already implies `spacedock-state/dev`).

## B3 — Commission scaffolding (journeys 1 & 2) — EXACT git mechanics

**Journey 1 (split, orphan-branch) — the spiked mechanic (§Spike (a), PASS).** Commission, for a
split workflow:
1. Writes README frontmatter `state: <path>` (e.g. `.spacedock-state`) + derived
   `state-branch: spacedock-state/<slug>` (omit if default; an explicit override may be written).
2. Adds `<path>/` to the code branch's `.gitignore` (so state commits never churn the code branch —
   R1).
3. Creates the orphan branch with a seed commit WITHOUT disturbing the code working tree. The spiked
   technique: birth the orphan in a temporary detached worktree, `git checkout --orphan <branch>`,
   then **clear the inherited index/tree** (`git rm -rf --cached .` + `rm -rf` the files — an orphan
   checkout inherits the source branch's tree, a real mechanic the spike surfaced), seed an initial
   state commit, remove the temp worktree.
4. Checks the orphan branch out at the gitignored `state:` path as a LINKED worktree of the main repo:
   `git worktree add <state-path> <state-branch>`.
5. (Optional, if `origin` exists) pushes the orphan branch: `git -C <state-path> push origin <branch>`.

Result: a freshly-commissioned split workflow is immediately usable — `spacedock status` renders, the
code branch is clean (spike confirmed `git status --porcelain` empty), state lives on its own branch.

**Journey 2 (inline) — trivial.** Commission writes `state: $inline` (explicit) OR omits `state:`
(empty → inline). Entities live beside the README on the same branch. No orphan branch, no worktree,
no gitignore entry. RECOMMEND commission write `$inline` explicitly for new inline workflows so the
backend choice is self-documenting and journey-3's "missing path-valued state" diagnostic stays
unambiguous.

**Proof altitude (AC-3).** A commission e2e: commissioning a split workflow yields an orphan-branch
state worktree that `spacedock status` renders + a clean code branch; commissioning inline yields
beside-the-README entities. The git-mechanics half (orphan-as-linked-worktree, gitignore, push) is
already PROVEN by §Spike (a); the e2e hardens the known-working path. Live workflow / integration
altitude (runtime claim). The skill-text changes to commission's SKILL.md (the journey-1 mechanics +
journey-2 prose) also carry a static skill-text test.

## B4 — `spacedock state init` (journey 3 resume) — the spiked mechanic

**Journey 3 (clone + resume) — the spiked mechanic (§Spike (b), PASS).** A fresh `git clone` of the
main repo brings the code branch; the state worktree is ABSENT (orphan branch not checked out, path
gitignored). `spacedock state init`:
1. Reads `state:` + `state-branch` from `{workflow-dir}/README.md` (default branch derived per B2).
2. If `state:` is `$inline`/empty → no-op (inline workflow has nothing to init; print a one-liner).
3. If split-root AND the `state:` path is **absent** on disk: `git fetch origin <state-branch>` then
   `git worktree add <state-path> <state-branch>`.
4. If the path is already present → idempotent no-op. **Guard explicitly**: the spike showed a second
   `git worktree add` FATALS with "already exists" (exit non-zero) — `state init` MUST check the path
   first and skip, not rely on git's no-op. RECOMMEND: present → `git fetch origin <branch>` +
   `git -C <state-path> pull --rebase` (refresh) then report, never re-`worktree add`.
5. Documented manual one-liner fallback (works today, IS the spike):
   `git fetch origin <branch> && git worktree add docs/dev/.spacedock-state <branch>`.

**Proof altitude (AC-4).** An e2e mirroring the Phase-A resume spike: build a main bare remote with a
commissioned split workflow + pushed orphan branch, fresh-clone main (state absent), run `state init`
(or the documented one-liner), assert `spacedock status` renders the seeded entity. Live
workflow / integration altitude. Mechanism PROVEN by §Spike (b).

## B5 — FO sanity-check halt-gate (journey 3, keyed on the Phase-A boot field)

**Recommendation: an FO-CONTRACT addition (not new code) keyed on the Phase-A boot fields.** At FO
startup the FO already reads `status --boot --json`. The gate:

> If `state_backend == "split-root"` AND `entity_dir_present == "false"`: the state checkout is not
> initialized. HALT dispatch. Report "state not initialized — run `spacedock state init` (or the
> manual `git fetch origin <branch> && git worktree add <state-path> <branch>`)." After init,
> re-read boot; proceed only when `entity_dir_present == "true"`.

**Why a contract, not a code gate.** The FO is a skill (first-officer SKILL.md), and the boot fields
Phase A ships make the condition a pure read — no new Go surface. This keeps B5 cheap and keeps the
halt-decision where the FO's other startup decisions live. (Alternative: a `spacedock doctor`/exit-code
gate in Go; heavier, and the FO must still interpret it — deferred unless the captain wants a
machine-checkable exit code.)

**Why this is safe.** Phase A's bonus diagnostic noted a 2nd host with absent state renders an EMPTY
table at exit 0 + `--validate` says VALID — a silent failure. The gate converts that silent-empty into
an explicit halt, so the FO never dispatches against a phantom-empty workflow.

**Proof altitude (AC-5).** The FO-contract text addition (first-officer SKILL.md) carries a static
skill-text test that the gate prose is present (the condition + the halt + the init pointer). The
behavioral half is the boot field itself, already pinned by Phase A's `json_boot_test.go`
(`entity_dir_present` for an absent vs present checkout). RECOMMEND a thin live-workflow smoke
(fresh clone → boot shows `entity_dir_present:false` → init → boot shows `true`) folded into B4's e2e
rather than a separate test — same fixture.

## B6 — Multi-writer sync: push / `pull --rebase` discipline (the spiked mechanic)

**Recommendation: extend the existing path-scoped-commit rule with MINIMAL sync points** (§Spike (c),
PASS). The state orphan branch is shared via `origin`; concurrent writers (FO + ensigns across hosts,
or even same-host parallel stages) must converge without clobbering.

**The minimal sync points (NOT every operation):**
- **After a state commit → push.** Whoever commits an entity/report pushes the orphan branch so peers
  can see it: `git -C <state-path> push origin <state-branch>`.
- **On push rejection (non-fast-forward) → `pull --rebase` then re-push.** The spike showed a
  concurrent writer's push is rejected; `git pull --rebase origin <state-branch>` replays the local
  path-scoped commit atop the peer's, yielding linear history (distinct entity files → no conflict),
  then the re-push succeeds. This is the load-bearing sync point.
- **At FO boot (before first dispatch) → `pull --rebase`** to integrate peers' state before computing
  dispatchability. One pull at boot, not per-read.
- **NOT pre-every-dispatch.** RECOMMEND against a pull before every dispatch (chatty, and the FO's
  boot pull + commit-time push already bound staleness to one round-trip). Pull-on-boot +
  push-after-commit + pull-on-rejection is the minimal sufficient set.

**Composition with the path-scoped-commit rule.** The existing rule (ensign core: stage + commit ONLY
your own entity path, never bare `git add -A`) is what makes `pull --rebase` clean: because each
writer commits exactly one entity file, concurrent writers touch disjoint paths → rebase replays with
no conflict (spike confirmed). B6 ADDS the push + pull-rebase steps; it does not change the commit
rule. Contract homes: the FO push/pull-on-boot in first-officer SKILL.md; the ensign
push-after-commit + pull-on-rejection in the ensign shared core (alongside the existing path-scoped
commit rule).

**Conflict handling (honest scope).** Two writers editing the SAME entity's frontmatter concurrently
CAN conflict on rebase. That is the path-scoped rule's known boundary; a full lock model is explicitly
out of scope (per the entity). The contract should say: on a rebase conflict the writer stops and
surfaces it (does not force-push), matching the existing "escalate rather than guess" discipline.

**Proof altitude (AC-6).** A 2-writer sync e2e: host A commits+pushes a state change, host B
`pull --rebase` sees it; the reverse direction with a push-rejection→pull-rebase→re-push round-trip.
The FO/ensign contract additions carry static skill-text tests for the push/pull-rebase prose. Live
git integration altitude (real clones, no mocks — the e2e rule). Mechanism PROVEN by §Spike (c).

## Spike — riskiest unknowns, all PASS (run 2026-05-31, throwaway sandbox)

Built a bare main `origin`, host A clone, host B clone — observed before designing:
- **(a) orphan-branch as linked worktree at gitignored path.** PASS. Birthed orphan in a temp detached
  worktree (clearing the inherited index/tree), checked it out at the gitignored `.spacedock-state`
  path via `git worktree add`, pushed to main `origin`. Code branch `git status --porcelain` was
  EMPTY (zero churn, R1 satisfied). Surfaced mechanic: orphan checkout inherits the source tree → must
  `git rm -rf --cached . && rm -rf` before seeding (folded into B3 step 3).
- **(b) `state init` from a fresh main clone.** PASS. Fresh clone → state path absent
  (`entity_dir_present:false`) → `git fetch origin <branch>` + `git worktree add <path> <branch>` →
  entity visible. Surfaced mechanic: a 2nd `worktree add` FATALS "already exists" → `state init` MUST
  guard with a path-exists check, not rely on git no-op (folded into B4 step 4).
- **(c) 2-writer `pull --rebase` sync.** PASS. A pushes; B's push rejected (non-fast-forward); B
  `pull --rebase` replays B's path-scoped commit atop A's → both entities present, linear history; B
  re-pushes; A `pull --rebase` sees B's. Distinct entity files → zero conflict (validates the
  path-scoped-commit + pull-rebase composition, B6).

Conclusion: every primitive the orphan-branch model needs is git-native and works end-to-end today;
the feature work is wiring (commission mechanics + `state init` + the two contract additions), not
inventing a sync mechanism.

## Migration note (this workflow's existing checkout — one-time, operational)

THIS workflow's `docs/dev/.spacedock-state` is currently shape-(a) (independent repo, no remote). To
adopt the orphan-branch model it must become a linked worktree of the main repo on an orphan branch
pushed to `origin`. That is a one-time operational migration (push the existing `spacedock-state/dev`
history to main `origin` as an orphan-style branch, re-add it as a linked worktree), NOT shipped
feature code. Flagged here so the captain can sequence it; it is not an AC of this entity.

## Internal sequencing proposal

1. **B1 + B2 (parser semantics) FIRST.** The `$inline` classifier + `state-branch` derivation are the
   foundation every other part reads; they are pure Go unit work with the cheapest proofs and zero
   architectural risk once the sentinel is chosen. Ship the shared `classifyState` + branch-derivation
   with their unit tests before anything depends on them. (This is the "what would invalidate the rest
   if it broke" item — the sentinel semantics — so it goes first, TDD-style.)
2. **B3 + B4 (commission + state init) SECOND.** Both are git-mechanics already spiked. B3 wires the
   commission scaffolding; B4 the `state init` subcommand. They depend on B1 (mode classification) and
   B2 (branch name). Proof: commission e2e + resume e2e.
3. **B5 + B6 (FO/ensign contracts) THIRD.** Both are skill-text contract additions keyed on the
   Phase-A boot field (B5) and the spiked sync points (B6). They depend on B4 (`state init` must exist
   for B5's halt to point at it) and on the path-scoped-commit rule (B6 extends it). Proof: static
   skill-text tests + the 2-writer e2e.

DEPENDS ON Phase A landing its boot `state_backend`/`entity_dir_present` fields (currently in
implementation) before B5 can key off them — sequence B5 after Phase A merges.

## Hardened acceptance criteria (behavior-first)

- **AC-1 — `state:` modes are explicit, via one shared classifier.** `$inline` → inline; empty →
  inline (backward-compat); a relative path → split-root; `$inline` is never joined as a literal path
  at any of the three read sites. Verified by status-parser Go unit tests over all three modes + the
  no-literal-join negative.
- **AC-2 — `state-branch` defaults to `spacedock-state/<slug>`, overridable.** Slug = workflow-dir
  basename (reproduces `spacedock-state/dev`); an explicit `state-branch:` wins. Verified by a Go unit
  derivation test; reproducible on this workflow.
- **AC-3 — Commission scaffolds both journeys.** Split commission → a usable orphan-branch state
  worktree + clean code branch; inline commission → beside-the-README entities. Verified by a
  commission e2e (git mechanics proven by §Spike (a)) + a static skill-text test on the new SKILL.md
  prose.
- **AC-4 — `spacedock state init` resumes a cloned shape-(1) repo, idempotently.** Fresh main clone →
  `state init` (fetch + worktree add, path-exists guarded) → `spacedock status` renders the entities;
  re-run is a no-op. Verified by an e2e mirroring §Spike (b).
- **AC-5 — FO sanity-check halts on uninitialized state and resumes after init.** `state_backend ==
  split-root && entity_dir_present == false` → FO halts + points at `state init`; after init proceeds.
  Verified by the FO-contract skill-text test + the Phase-A boot-field behavior (json_boot_test.go),
  with a thin live smoke folded into the B4 e2e.
- **AC-6 — Push/`pull --rebase` sync is contractual and exercised.** A 2-writer e2e: A commits+pushes,
  B `pull --rebase` sees it, and a push-rejection→pull-rebase→re-push round-trip; the FO push/pull-on-
  boot and ensign push-after-commit/pull-on-rejection rules carry the contract. Verified by the
  2-writer e2e (§Spike (c) proves the mechanism) + static skill-text tests.

## Test plan (cost / altitude)

- **B1** — Go unit tests on the shared `classifyState` over three modes + no-literal-join negative,
  exercised through all three call sites (resolveRoots, splitRootStateCheckout, discoverWorkflows
  prune). Cheap (~minutes), parser altitude. RED-first.
- **B2** — Go unit test on branch-name derivation (basename + override). Cheap, command altitude.
- **B3** — commission e2e (real git: orphan worktree, gitignore, status renders, clean code branch) +
  a static skill-text test on the SKILL.md mechanics prose. Moderate (real git, no mocks per the e2e
  rule); mechanism PROVEN by §Spike (a).
- **B4** — resume e2e (bare main remote + commissioned split workflow → fresh clone → `state init` →
  status renders; idempotent re-run). Moderate (real clone, no mocks); mechanism PROVEN by §Spike (b).
- **B5** — static skill-text test on first-officer SKILL.md (the halt-gate prose) + reuse Phase-A's
  `json_boot_test.go` for the boot field; a thin live smoke folded into B4's e2e. Cheap.
- **B6** — 2-writer sync e2e (real clones: push, rejection, pull --rebase, re-push) + static
  skill-text tests on the FO/ensign push/pull-rebase contract prose. Moderate (real git, no mocks);
  mechanism PROVEN by §Spike (c).

Total: 2 cheap Go-unit suites (B1/B2), 3 real-git e2es (B3/B4/B6, mechanisms all spiked → hardening
not discovery), and static skill-text assertions for the prose/contract changes (B3/B5/B6). No mocks
anywhere (live git per the e2e rule).

# Ideation rework (2026-05-31) — staff-review findings M-1..M-4

Independent staff review returned **PASS-WITH-CONCERNS**: the core design (orphan-branch state,
`$inline`, state-init resume, FO sanity-check, push/pull sync) is sound and builds on Phase A
correctly. This section reworks the four findings and re-affirms the recommended decomposition. The
spikes (§Spike) are NOT re-run — they stand; this rework changes only the design's framing of the
migration gate, the strength of the classifier requirement, the sync-conflict failure mode, and the
e2e fidelity requirement. **Where this section conflicts with an earlier framing above, this section
governs.** The earlier "Migration note" (operational/deferred) and the B1/B2 "recommendation" wording
are superseded by M-1 and M-2 below.

## Verified current state of THIS workflow's checkout (re-grounded for the rework, 2026-05-31)

Re-inspected `docs/dev/.spacedock-state` directly before reworking, because M-1 hinges on its actual
shape and the dispatch noted "state-remote already applied (origin=main repo, spacedock-state/dev
pushed)":
- Its `.git` is a **directory** (`hooks/`/`info/`/`logs/` present); `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`
  returns its own `.git`. It is an **independent repo**, NOT a linked worktree.
- It DOES now carry `origin = git@github.com:spacedock-dev/spacedock.git` (the main repo's origin) on
  branch `spacedock-state/dev` — so the *remote* half of the migration is done (it is a clone of main
  origin, branch pushed).
- The main repo's `git worktree list` does **NOT** include `docs/dev/.spacedock-state` → it is not yet
  a linked worktree of the main repo.
- The path is currently ignored only via the **local, uncommitted** `.git/info/exclude`
  (`**/.spacedock-state/`), NOT a committed `.gitignore` entry — so the ignore is invisible to a fresh
  clone / to collaborators.

**Net:** the checkout is structurally shape-(a) (independent repo) with the remote wired, but NOT yet
shape-(c) (linked worktree on an orphan branch of the main repo). The remaining migration is the
load-bearing step M-1 is about.

## M-1 (CRITICAL) — the shape-(a)→(c) migration is a LOAD-BEARING PRE-GATE for B5/B6, not a post-ship step

The earlier "Migration note" framed converting this checkout as a one-time *operational* step and
explicitly said it "is not an AC of this entity." **That framing is wrong and is hereby superseded.**
B5's halt-gate is keyed on `state_backend == "split-root" && entity_dir_present == "false"`. That
condition is only **meaningfully testable** once the state checkout is a *linked worktree on the
orphan branch* — because only then does the path's absence (fresh clone / `git worktree remove`)
correspond to the real "orphan branch exists on origin but is not checked out → run `state init`" state
the gate is designed to catch. While the checkout remains an *independent clone* sitting at the path,
"absence" is not reachable through the shipped model (a fresh clone of main does not even reference
that independent repo), so B5/B6 cannot be exercised against this workflow end-to-end. The migration
is therefore **on the critical path** between B4 and B5, not an afterthought.

**The migration as an explicit pre-gate (the remaining step, given the remote is already wired):**
1. Confirm `spacedock-state/dev` is pushed to main `origin` (done — verified above).
2. Commit the `.spacedock-state/` ignore to the code branch's tracked `.gitignore` (it is currently
   only in local `.git/info/exclude`, so collaborators/fresh clones do not ignore it). This is R1
   (zero code-branch churn) made durable, not just local.
3. Replace the independent clone at `docs/dev/.spacedock-state` with a **linked worktree** of the main
   repo on `spacedock-state/dev`: move/remove the standalone clone, then
   `git worktree add docs/dev/.spacedock-state spacedock-state/dev` from the main repo. The branch
   history is already on origin (step 1), so no history is lost.
4. Verify: main repo `git worktree list` now lists `docs/dev/.spacedock-state`; `spacedock status`
   still renders; the code branch `git status --porcelain` is empty (R1 holds).

**Sequencing consequence (the gate):** B1/B2 (parser) and B3/B4 (commission + `state init`) stay on
the critical path and do NOT depend on the migration — they are exercised in throwaway sandboxes /
fresh fixtures (per the spikes), where the linked-worktree shape is created from scratch by commission
itself. **B5 and B6 DEPEND ON the migration having landed for this workflow**, because their behavior
is verified against this workflow's real checkout (the FO boots this workflow; the 2-writer sync rides
this workflow's orphan branch on origin). Concretely: B5/B6 are blocked-by the migration; B1–B4 are
not. The migration is an explicit pre-gate before B5/B6 implementation, surfaced for the captain to
sequence, and it becomes a tracked gating item — not "not an AC."

## M-2 — `classifyState` (all three sites) + the validator allowing `$inline` is a MUST, not a recommendation

The earlier B1 said "Recommendation: a single shared classifier." **Elevated to MUST.** The grounding
makes the necessity hard, not stylistic:

- The only `state:` rejection set that exists today is in `resolveRoots` (roots.go:59-65): it rejects
  **absolute** and **`..`-escaping** values. `$inline` is **neither** — it is a relative, non-escaping
  token. Verified: there is no `$inline` handling anywhere in `internal/` today. So **without**
  `classifyState`, every site treats `$inline` as an ordinary relative path and joins it:
  - `resolveRoots` → `entityDir = definitionDir/$inline`,
  - `splitRootStateCheckout` (helpers.go:127-135) → `workflowDir/$inline`,
  - `discoverWorkflows` prune (handlers.go:378-383) → prunes `definitionDir/$inline`.
  A literal `…/$inline` directory would be created/scanned. This is a correctness defect, not a
  preference — hence MUST.
- **The validator inherits this through `resolveRoots`.** Verified: `validateWorkflow` does NOT parse
  `state:` itself; it receives `entityDir` from `resolveRoots` (handlers.go:229 and
  native_runner.go:316 both pass `roots.entityDir`). There is therefore **no separate validator
  rejection set to amend** — the requirement is precisely that the shared `classifyState` (which
  `resolveRoots` MUST call) maps `$inline → inline` so `entityDir == definitionDir`. With that,
  `--validate` enumerates entities beside the README (correct), instead of validating an empty/literal
  `…/$inline` dir. "The validator MUST allow `$inline` through" = "the validator's `entityDir` comes
  from a classifier that treats `$inline` as inline." Stating the mechanism so the implementer does not
  hunt for a nonexistent second rejection list.

**MUST, concretely:**
- `classifyState(stateValue) → (mode, relPath, err)` MUST exist in `internal/status` and be the SINGLE
  point where `state:` is interpreted. All three read sites (resolveRoots, splitRootStateCheckout,
  discoverWorkflows prune) MUST call it. The existing absolute/`..` rejection MUST move INTO the
  classifier so all three share one validation.
- `classifyState` MUST map `$inline` (exact, post-`TrimSpace`) → `inline` and empty → `inline`,
  returning no path to join; any other value → `split-root` after the absolute/`..` check.
- **Negative test (MUST):** assert that `resolveRoots`, `splitRootStateCheckout`, and
  `discoverWorkflows` do NOT create or reference a literal `$inline` directory — i.e.
  `resolveRoots($inline).entityDir == definitionDir` (no `/$inline` suffix),
  `splitRootStateCheckout($inline) == ""`, and the prune scan over a `$inline` workflow leaves no
  `…/$inline` path on disk and prunes nothing. This negative is the regression guard that the three
  sites never re-acquire the literal-join behavior.

## M-3 — B6 sync rebase-conflict FAILURE MODE is contractual: HALT, surface, no force-push, no auto-resolve

The earlier B6 "Conflict handling" said the writer "stops and surfaces it (does not force-push)."
**Made explicit and contractual:**

> **Rebase-conflict halt (B6 contract).** When a writer runs `git pull --rebase origin <state-branch>`
> (at FO boot, or after a push rejection) and the rebase **conflicts** — the only realistic cause is
> two writers editing the SAME entity's frontmatter concurrently, the path-scoped rule's known
> boundary — the writer MUST:
> 1. **HALT** the operation in progress (dispatch, at the FO; commit/push, at an ensign). Do not
>    proceed against an unmerged state tree.
> 2. **Abort the rebase** (`git rebase --abort`) to leave the checkout in a clean, known state.
> 3. **Surface** the conflict to the captain/operator with the conflicting entity path(s) and the
>    peer commit, and **stop**. This is manual intervention.
> 4. MUST NOT `--force`/`--force-with-lease` push, and MUST NOT auto-resolve (no `-X ours/theirs`, no
>    discarding either side). Either choice silently loses a peer's frontmatter edit.
>
> This matches the existing **escalate-rather-than-guess** discipline (ensign core: "If requirements
> are unclear or ambiguous, escalate to the first officer rather than guessing"). A full lock model is
> out of scope (per the entity); the halt IS the boundary behavior for the rare same-entity collision.

Contract homes (unchanged from B6 above): the FO pull-on-boot + halt-on-conflict in first-officer
SKILL.md; the ensign push-after-commit + pull-on-rejection + halt-on-conflict in the ensign shared
core, alongside the path-scoped-commit rule. The static skill-text tests for B6 MUST assert the
halt/abort/surface/no-force-push prose is present at both homes, not just the happy-path push/pull.

## M-4 — B3/B4/B6 e2es MUST replicate the SPIKED mechanics with captured fixtures/assertions

The spikes (§Spike) proved the mechanism in a throwaway sandbox. The e2es MUST **replicate those exact
mechanics with captured fixtures and explicit assertions**, not re-derive the git steps from memory —
otherwise the e2e can pass while exercising a subtly different (and unspiked) path. Per spiked
mechanic, the e2e MUST capture and assert:

- **B3 (commission, replicates §Spike (a) — orphan-as-linked-worktree):** the e2e MUST perform the
  spiked sequence verbatim — birth orphan in a temp detached worktree, `--orphan`, **clear the
  inherited index/tree** (`git rm -rf --cached . && rm -rf`), seed, `git worktree add` at the
  gitignored path, push. Captured assertions: the orphan branch exists on origin; `docs/...` state
  path is a **linked worktree** (appears in `git worktree list`); code-branch `git status --porcelain`
  is **empty** (R1); `spacedock status` renders the seeded entity. The "clear inherited tree" step is
  the spike-surfaced mechanic that MUST be present and asserted (assert the orphan's initial tree has
  NO code-branch files), since omitting it silently regresses to a polluted state branch.
- **B4 (`state init`, replicates §Spike (b) — fresh-clone resume + path-exists guard):** fixture = a
  bare main remote with a commissioned split workflow + pushed orphan branch; fresh-clone main (state
  path absent). Captured assertions: pre-init `status --boot --json` shows `entity_dir_present:false`;
  `state init` (= `git fetch origin <branch>` + `git worktree add`) makes `spacedock status` render
  the seeded entity; **a second `state init` is a no-op** and does NOT FATAL — the spike surfaced that
  a 2nd `git worktree add` fatals "already exists", so the e2e MUST assert the path-exists guard skips
  re-`worktree add` (exit 0, no fatal), not rely on git's behavior.
- **B6 (2-writer sync, replicates §Spike (c) — push / rejection / pull-rebase / re-push):** fixture =
  bare main origin + host-A clone + host-B clone. Captured assertions, both directions: A
  commits+pushes a path-scoped entity commit; B's push is **rejected** (non-fast-forward); B
  `pull --rebase` replays B's path-scoped commit atop A's with **zero conflict** (distinct entity
  files) → both entities present + **linear history**; B re-pushes; A `pull --rebase` sees B's. PLUS a
  **conflict-path assertion for M-3**: two writers edit the SAME entity's frontmatter, the
  `pull --rebase` conflicts, and the e2e asserts the writer **aborts the rebase and halts** (clean
  checkout, non-zero/surfaced, NO force-push) rather than silently merging — exercising the M-3
  failure mode, not just the happy path.

All three e2es use **real git, no mocks** (the e2e rule). Mechanisms are PROVEN by the spikes; the
e2es harden the known-working path AND pin the spike-surfaced gotchas (clear-inherited-tree,
path-exists guard, rebase-conflict halt) as regression guards.

## Re-affirmed decomposition (the reviewer's cut)

The staff review recommended, and this rework adopts, this implementation cut:
- **B.1 = B1 + B2 + B3** — parser semantics (`classifyState` MUST + `state-branch` derivation) and
  commission scaffolding. Self-contained Go-unit + commission-e2e work; no dependency on this
  workflow's migration (commission builds the linked-worktree shape from scratch in a fixture).
- **B.2 = B4** — `spacedock state init` (the fresh-clone resume subcommand), with its resume e2e.
  Depends on B.1's mode classification + branch derivation.
- **B.3 (post-migration) = B5 + B6** — the FO halt-gate contract (B5) and the multi-writer
  push/pull-rebase + halt-on-conflict contract (B6), with the 2-writer e2e. **B.3 is gated on the
  M-1 migration having landed for this workflow** (and on Phase A's boot fields, already merged), since
  B5/B6 are verified against this workflow's real linked-worktree-on-orphan-branch checkout.

This supersedes the earlier "Internal sequencing proposal" only in grouping (B3 joins B1/B2 in B.1)
and in making the migration an explicit gate before B.3; the dependency reasoning (B1/B2 first, B5
after Phase A) is unchanged.

## Acceptance-criteria deltas from the rework

The hardened AC-1..AC-6 above stand, with these strengthenings folded in:
- **AC-1** — "via one shared classifier" is now a MUST; the no-literal-`$inline`-join negative is a
  required test at all three sites (M-2).
- **AC-5 / AC-6** — add an explicit **migration pre-gate** as a tracked gating item for B.3: B5/B6 are
  verified only after `docs/dev/.spacedock-state` is a linked worktree on the orphan branch (M-1). The
  migration is a gating deliverable, not "not an AC."
- **AC-6** — adds the rebase-**conflict halt** assertion (abort + surface + no force-push) to the
  2-writer e2e and the contract skill-text tests (M-3), and requires the e2es to replicate the spiked
  mechanics with captured fixtures (M-4).

## Stage Report: ideation

- DONE: Design B1 + B2 (semantics): finalize a non-colliding explicit-inline sentinel for `state:` (captain suggested `$inline`) with empty→inline backward-compat and path→split-root, and the resolveRoots/splitRootStateCheckout handling (sentinel treated as inline, NOT joined as a path); plus the workflow-slug-derived `state-branch` default (`spacedock-state/<slug>`, overridable via README). Give concrete parser behavior + proof altitude (status-parser tests over all three modes; branch-name derivation test).
  B1 recommends ONE shared `classifyState` consumed by all THREE `state:` read sites (resolveRoots roots.go:55, splitRootStateCheckout helpers.go:127, discoverWorkflows prune handlers.go:378 — grounded), `$inline` treated as inline (never joined), with the no-literal-join negative test. B2 derives `spacedock-state/<basename>` (reproduces the shipped `spacedock-state/dev`), README override wins; Go-unit derivation proof.
- DONE: Design B3 + B4 + B5 (the journeys' mechanics): B3 commission scaffolding (EXACT orphan-branch-as-linked-worktree git mechanics) + inline; B4 `spacedock state init`; B5 the FO halt-gate keyed on the Phase-A `entity_dir_present` boot field. Name the proofs.
  B3 gives the spiked step-by-step (temp detached worktree → `--orphan` → clear inherited tree → seed → `git worktree add` at gitignored path → push); B4 the `state init` fetch+worktree-add with the path-exists idempotency guard the spike surfaced; B5 an FO-CONTRACT gate on `state_backend==split-root && entity_dir_present==false` (no new code — Phase A already ships the fields). Proofs: commission e2e, resume e2e, FO skill-text + Phase-A json_boot_test.
- DONE: Design B6 (multi-writer sync) + SPIKE the riskiest unknowns + propose internal sequencing + harden AC-1..AC-6.
  B6 = minimal sync points (FO pull-on-boot, push-after-commit, pull-rebase-on-rejection; NOT pre-every-dispatch) composing with the path-scoped-commit rule. SPIKED all three unknowns end-to-end (orphan-as-linked-worktree, state init from fresh clone, 2-writer pull --rebase) — ALL PASS, surfacing two real mechanics (orphan inherits source tree; 2nd worktree-add fatals) folded into B3/B4. Sequenced B1/B2 → B3/B4 → B5/B6; AC-1..AC-6 hardened behavior-first.

### Summary

Designed Phase B as the captain-fixed same-repo orphan-branch model, superseding Phase A's separate-repo recommendation. Headline findings: (1) `state:` is read at THREE sites that all treat non-empty as a path-to-join, so `$inline` needs ONE shared classifier or a site joins a literal `…/$inline` — the load-bearing B1 decision; (2) Phase A already ships the exact boot fields (`state_backend`, `entity_dir_present`) B5's halt-gate keys off, so B5 is a pure FO-contract addition with no new code; (3) all three riskiest unknowns were SPIKED end-to-end and PASS, surfacing two concrete mechanics (orphan checkout inherits the source tree → clear it before seeding; a 2nd `worktree add` fatals → `state init` must path-guard) now folded into the design. Sequencing: B1/B2 parser → B3/B4 commission+init → B5/B6 contracts, with B5 gated on Phase A merging. No code committed (ideation, design-only).

## Stage Report: ideation (cycle 2 — staff-review rework M-1..M-4)

- DONE: M-1 (CRITICAL) — recast the shape-(a)→(c) migration from "operational/not-an-AC" to a LOAD-BEARING PRE-GATE that explicitly gates B5/B6.
  Re-grounded this workflow's checkout: independent repo (`.git` dir, own common-dir) with origin=main repo + `spacedock-state/dev` pushed, but NOT yet a linked worktree (main `git worktree list` excludes it; ignore is only in local `.git/info/exclude`). Stated the remaining migration (commit `.gitignore`, replace clone with `git worktree add` linked worktree) as an explicit pre-gate; B1–B4 not migration-dependent, B5/B6 blocked-by migration-landed; made it a tracked gating item, not "not an AC."
- DONE: M-2 — elevated `classifyState` (all three sites) + validator-allows-`$inline` from recommendation to MUST.
  Verified the only `state:` rejection set is roots.go:59-65 (absolute + `..`), and `$inline` is in neither set → without the classifier all three sites join a literal `…/$inline`. Verified the validator has NO own `state:` parse — it inherits `entityDir` from `resolveRoots` (handlers.go:229, native_runner.go:316), so "validator allows `$inline`" = "resolveRoots' classifier maps `$inline → inline`." Specified the MUST + the no-literal-`$inline`-join negative test at all three sites.
- DONE: M-3 — specified B6's rebase-conflict FAILURE MODE as a contract: HALT, `git rebase --abort`, surface the conflicting entity + peer commit, stop; NO force-push, NO auto-resolve.
  Tied to the existing escalate-rather-than-guess discipline; contract homes at FO + ensign-core; static skill-text tests MUST assert the halt/abort/surface prose at both homes.
- DONE: M-4 — required B3/B4/B6 e2es to replicate the spiked mechanics with captured fixtures/assertions (clear-inherited-tree assert, path-exists-guard no-fatal assert, push-rejection→pull-rebase + the M-3 conflict-halt assert); re-affirmed the reviewer's B.1 (B1+B2+B3) / B.2 (B4) / B.3-post-migration (B5+B6) decomposition.
  Folded the AC deltas: AC-1 classifier-is-MUST + negative; AC-5/AC-6 migration pre-gate as a tracked gating item; AC-6 conflict-halt assertion + spike-replication fixtures.

### Summary

Reworked the four staff-review findings without re-running the spikes (they stand). The substantive change is M-1: re-inspecting this workflow's `docs/dev/.spacedock-state` showed it is now a clone of main origin on `spacedock-state/dev` (remote wired) but still an independent repo, not a linked worktree — so the shape-(a)→(c) migration is the remaining load-bearing step and B5/B6 (verified against this workflow's real checkout) genuinely depend on it; recast as an explicit pre-gate, not a post-ship operational note. M-2 hardened to a MUST after grounding that `$inline` is in no current rejection set and the validator inherits `entityDir` from `resolveRoots` (no separate validator list to amend). M-3 made the rebase-conflict failure mode a halt/abort/surface/no-force-push contract; M-4 required the e2es to replicate the spiked git mechanics with captured assertions and re-affirmed the B.1/B.2/B.3-post-migration cut. Design-only; the entity body + this report committed to the .spacedock-state checkout, no code changed.

## Stage Report: implementation

- DONE: [B.1 / M-2 MUST] `classifyState(stateValue) → (mode, relPath, err)` is the SINGLE shared `state:` interpreter in internal/status, consumed by ALL THREE read sites — resolveRoots, splitRootStateCheckout, discoverWorkflows prune. `$inline`→inline (NEVER joined as a path), empty→inline, any other→split-root. MOVE the absolute/`..` rejection INTO the classifier and DELETE the duplicated check at handlers.go:378-383. Required negative test: none of the three sites ever creates/references a literal `…/$inline` path. + `state-branch` derivation (spacedock-state/<workflow-dir-basename>, overridable by a README `state-branch:`).
  `ClassifyState` is `internal/status/state.go` (exported so `dispatch` consumes it); all FOUR `state:` read sites route through it — resolveRoots (roots.go:53), splitRootStateCheckout (helpers.go:126), discoverWorkflows prune (handlers.go:414, dup check deleted), and the fourth site stateCheckoutParent (discover_walkup.go:52). Absolute/`..` rejection lives only in the classifier. M-2 negative at every site: classify_state_test.go + inline_sentinel_sites_test.go + dispatch/inline_sentinel_checkout_test.go (20 asserts). `StateBranch` derives spacedock-state/<basename>, README override wins (state_branch_test.go). Commit 21594793.
- DONE: [B.1+B.2 / M-4] commission scaffolding + `spacedock state init` REPLICATE the spiked git mechanics with CAPTURED assertions (real git, no mocks): commission(split) = orphan birthed in a temp detached worktree → `--orphan` → CLEAR the inherited index/tree → seed → `git worktree add` at the gitignored path → push; `state init` = `git fetch` + `git worktree add` with a PATH-EXISTS guard; `$inline`/empty → no-op.
  `spacedock state init` is internal/cli/state.go, wired as a cobra `state` command. state_init_test.go: TestCommissionOrphanBranchScaffolding asserts orphan-on-origin + linked-worktree + clear-inherited-tree (orphan tree has NO code files) + clean code-branch porcelain (R1) + status renders; TestStateInitResumesFreshClone asserts pre-init entity_dir_present:false → init → status renders → 2nd init no-op (no "already exists" fatal); TestStateInitInlineNoOp. Commit f1c78477.
- DONE: [B.3 / M-3] FO + ensign sync contracts: B5 halt-gate + B6 push-after-commit / pull-on-boot / pull-on-rejection, with the M-3 rebase-conflict HALT contract at BOTH the FO and ensign homes. 2-writer real-clone e2e incl the conflict-halt assertion + static skill-text tests asserting the halt/abort/surface prose.
  first-officer-shared-core.md: Startup steps 6 (halt-gate keyed on state_backend==split-root && entity_dir_present==false → HALT + state init pointer) + 7 (pull-on-boot); State Management gains push/pull-rebase sync + the M-3 rebase-conflict halt. ensign-shared-core.md gains push-after-commit/pull-on-rejection/halt alongside the path-scoped rule. commission SKILL.md journey-1 (orphan mechanics) + journey-2 ($inline). 3q fold-in: ship-local `merge:` is read on-demand at each guard, not at boot (verified resolveMergePolicy call sites). 2-writer e2e state_sync_test.go (happy-path linear-history + M-3 same-entity conflict→abort→no-force-push→peer-edit-survives). Static skill-text tests split_root_sync_contract_test.go (7/7 in hostneutrality). Commit 7948281e.

### Summary

Implemented Phase B against the captain-fixed orphan-branch model. The load-bearing decision (B.1/M-2) is one shared `ClassifyState` so `$inline` is never literal-joined — wired through all four `state:` read sites with the rejection centralized and the prune dup deleted; `StateBranch` derives spacedock-state/<basename>. `spacedock state init` (new cobra command) and the commission orphan-branch scaffolding are proven by real-git e2es that replicate the spiked mechanics with captured assertions (clear-inherited-tree, path-exists guard, fresh-clone resume). B5/B6/M-3 are contract additions in the vendored FO + ensign cores + commission SKILL.md, with a 2-writer real-clone e2e (happy-path + same-entity conflict→abort→halt) and static skill-text tests; folded in the 3q `merge:`-read-on-demand correction. M-1 step 2 (`.spacedock-state/` → tracked `.gitignore`) is done; the live state plumbing was NOT touched. 593 package tests pass; the only failure is the documented env-only `TestCodexResolveManifestAgainstInstalledHost` (codex CLI config in this sandbox). Existing single-root parity stays green (classifyState maps empty→inline identically); the oracle is unchanged (native-only divergences).

## Stage Report: validation

- DONE: [B.1] INDEPENDENTLY reproduce on the branch binary: `ClassifyState` routes ALL FOUR `state:` read sites — resolveRoots, splitRootStateCheckout, discoverWorkflows prune, AND the 4th site stateCheckoutParent (discover_walkup.go). `$inline`→inline with NO literal `…/$inline` path created/referenced at ANY of the four; empty→inline; a path→split-root. The absolute/`..` rejection is centralized in the classifier only (the handlers.go dup is deleted). Single-root parity stays green. Tamper-confirm at least one negative genuinely guards.
  All four sites route through `status.ClassifyState`: resolveRoots (roots.go:54), splitRootStateCheckout (helpers.go:126), discoverWorkflows prune (handlers.go:414), stateCheckoutParent (discover_walkup.go:52). Diff confirms the dup absolute/`..` checks were DELETED from roots.go/handlers.go/discover_walkup.go and centralized in ClassifyState. Negatives pass at all four sites (classify_state_test, inline_sentinel_sites_test, dispatch/inline_sentinel_checkout_test). Single-root parity green: TestResolveRootsStateField (set/absent/empty), TestNativeDiscoverParity, TestResolveRootsStateRejected, TestSplitRootDiscoverySingleCount. TAMPER: bypassed the classifier in splitRootStateCheckout to literal-join → TestSplitRootStateCheckoutInlineSentinel FAILED with the exact `…/$inline` join; restored, re-green.
- DONE: [B.2 / M-4] The commission + `state init` e2es exercise REAL git (no mocks) and pin the spike-surfaced gotchas. Build the branch binary and run them; spot-tamper one mechanic and confirm the e2e catches it.
  Built /tmp/spacedock-branch-bin from the worktree. state_init_test.go is genuine real-git (bare origin, real clones/orphan-branch/worktrees, runs the actual `state init` via run(...)): TestCommissionOrphanBranchScaffolding asserts orphan-on-origin + linked-worktree (git worktree list) + CLEARED inherited tree (ls-tree shows NO README/.gitignore/docs) + clean code-branch porcelain (R1) + status renders; TestStateInitResumesFreshClone asserts entity_dir_present:false → init → status renders → 2nd init no-op (no "already exists" fatal); TestStateInitInlineNoOp ($inline/empty → no-op). All PASS. TAMPER: skipped the path-exists guard in state.go → TestStateInitResumesFreshClone FAILED, 2nd init leaked git's "already exists" fatal; restored, re-green.
- DONE: [B.3 / B5 / B6 / M-3] The FO + ensign sync contracts are present AND correct in BOTH vendored cores; the 2-writer real-clone e2e asserts BOTH happy-path linear history AND same-entity conflict → abort → halt → peer's edit survives. Confirm M-1 step 2 + the 3q fold landed.
  FO shared-core: B5 halt-gate (step 6, state_backend==split-root && entity_dir_present==false → HALT + state-init pointer) + B6 pull-on-boot (step 7) + push-after-commit/pull-on-rejection + M-3 halt (HALT/abort/surface/no-force/no-auto-resolve). Ensign shared-core: push-after-commit/pull-on-rejection + the identical M-3 halt. Static skill-text tests (split_root_sync_contract_test.go) assert all token sets PASS. 2-writer e2e (state_sync_test.go) real-git: TestTwoWriterSyncHappyPath (push/non-ff-reject/pull-rebase/linear-history/re-push) + TestTwoWriterSameEntityConflictHalts (real CONFLICT → rebase-in-progress → abort → clean tree → plain push stays rejected → A's edit survives on origin) PASS. Grep confirms NO `git push --force`/`--force-with-lease` and NO `-X ours/theirs`/`--strategy-option` anywhere in the sync code/e2es (the `--force` hits are the pre-existing mod-block flag + `worktree remove --force` + prohibition prose). M-1 step 2 = `**/.spacedock-state/` in the tracked `.gitignore` (verified diff). 3q fold = FO prose now says `merge:` is "read on-demand by the status viewer at each terminal-transition guard" — grounded: resolveMergePolicy is called at handlers.go:159 + mutate.go:223 (the guards), not at boot. TAMPER: injected a force-push before the anti-clobber assertion → TestTwoWriterSameEntityConflictHalts FAILED (A's edit clobbered); restored, re-green.

### Summary

VERDICT: PASSED. Independently verified all six ACs on the branch binary (HEAD 7948281e). All four `state:` read sites route through the single shared `ClassifyState`; the absolute/`..` rejection is centralized (downstream dups deleted) and `$inline` is never literal-joined at any site — three independent tamper-confirms (literal-join, path-exists-guard, force-push) each genuinely broke the corresponding negative, so the guards are real, not vacuous. The commission/state-init/2-writer e2es are genuine real-git (bare origin + real clones/orphan-branch/worktrees, no mocks) and replicate the spiked mechanics with captured assertions. The B5/B6/M-3 contracts are present and correct at BOTH the FO and ensign homes, the rebase-conflict path neither force-pushes nor auto-resolves (grep-confirmed across code + tests), and the peer-edit-survives assertion is load-bearing. M-1 step 2 (tracked `.gitignore`) and the 3q `merge:`-read-on-demand fold both landed and are grounded in the code. The oracle is unchanged and single-root parity stays green (native-only divergences as scoped); no live `docs/dev/.spacedock-state` git plumbing was touched by this branch. The only test failure is the documented env-only `TestCodexResolveManifestAgainstInstalledHost` (codex CLI absent in this sandbox) — a NON-regression. 9/10 packages green; cli green except that one env-only case.
