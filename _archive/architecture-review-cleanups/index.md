The NOW-SAFE cleanups surfaced by the architecture review (`docs/dev/_reviews/architecture-review.md`). The review found the core architecturally sound with NO rework required; these are the small, contained, in-place fixes worth landing during the implementation drain. POST-BOOTSTRAP parity-debt is explicitly NOT here (it goes elsewhere — see Out of scope).

## Acceptance criteria (behavioral)

**AC-1 — `pyJoin` is shared, not byte-duplicated across the status↔dispatch seam.**
Verified by: `pyJoin` is exported as `status.PyJoin` and `internal/dispatch` consumes it (the byte-identical copy at `internal/dispatch/helpers.go:171-187` is deleted); `go build ./...` clean and the existing abs-worktree parity test still passes (both sides necessarily match `os.path.join`). This removes the silent-divergence hazard the review flagged (the absolute-component-wins quirk lived in two copies).

**AC-2 — Status parity tests FAIL, not skip, when the Python oracle is absent.**
Verified by: with the oracle pointed away (env unset / hardcoded laptop path absent), the strongest status parity assertions (`TestNativeReadMatchesOracle`, `TestNativeValidationParity`, the `TestInd*` matrix) FAIL rather than `t.Skip()` — observed by running with `SPACEDOCK_ORACLE` unset and watching them error (today ~66 subtests go green-by-skip on CI/a fresh clone). Mirror the dispatch package's tree-relative vendored-oracle + `t.Fatalf` pattern (`parity_harness_test.go:32`), or at minimum hard-fail in CI when the oracle var is unset. This is a test-integrity fix: the suite must not report PASS while the real parity assertions silently did not run.

**AC-3 — The verified dead code / test-hygiene items are removed; the suite stays green.**
Verified by: `go vet ./...` + `go test ./...` green after removing — dead struct field `roots.definitionDirSpelling` (written, never read; `roots.go:29,51`), unused `(*entity).get` (`discover.go:45-48`, zero callers), the one-line passthrough `runGit` (inline into its single caller, `native_runner.go:490-493`), the value-free `sortStrings` alias (`orderedmap.go:32-33`), the two `_ = strings.TrimSpace` import-keeping crutches (`native_usage_test.go:66`, `native_validate_test.go:150`), and the test-side SD-B32 alphabet re-anchored to the production `sdB32Chars` constant (`nextid_boot_test.go:12` vs `identity.go:18`). Each is a verified-zero-risk removal per the review.

## Test gates

- `go test ./...` + `-race`, `gofmt -l`, `go vet` — all green with captured exit codes.
- AC-2's oracle-absent-fails behavior demonstrated (run with the oracle var unset → the parity tests FAIL).

## Out of scope (goes elsewhere)

- **Scope the "Python-free" claim honestly** (review must-fix #4) → `claude-runtime-segregation` (zs) owns it (it moves context-budget native + reorganizes the contract).
- **`--quiet`** — captain elected to KEEP it; not pruned.
- **POST-BOOTSTRAP parity-debt** → the `yaml-parser-migration` / parsing-modernization follow-up: collapse the six mutual-exclusion flag-blocks (post-parity), retire VendorRunner + the embedded Python script (post-parity-certification), tighten Python schema_version quirks (post-oracle). And the bare-mode team-evidence `~/.claude/teams` mtime probe relocation to the FO adapter is a zs-adjacent post-bootstrap item.

## Notes

Touches `internal/status` + `internal/dispatch` (the `pyJoin` seam) — sequences with the other internal/status entities (after packaging; can fold into the implementation drain). Small, low-risk, behavior-preserving. The review's full finding list is at `docs/dev/_reviews/architecture-review.md`.

## Stage Report: implementation

- DONE: AC-1: share pyJoin across the internal/status <-> internal/dispatch seam (currently byte-duplicated) — one definition, both call sites.
  Exported `status.PyJoin` (was `status.pyJoin`); `internal/dispatch` consumes it at both call sites (`build.go:228,354`); deleted the byte-identical dispatch copy (`helpers.go`). `TestBuildAbsoluteWorktreeParity` passes. Commit 924a588c.
- DONE: AC-3: remove the verified dead code / test-hygiene items the entity body lists; the full suite stays green.
  Removed `roots.definitionDirSpelling` (written-never-read), `(*entity).get` (zero callers — `env.get`/`orderedMap.get` retained), inlined `runGit` into `runGitCmd` at its single caller, inlined the `sortStrings` alias to `sort.Strings` at 3 sites, dropped the two `_ = strings.TrimSpace` crutches + their now-unused `strings` imports, re-anchored test `sdB32Alphabet` to production `sdB32Chars`. Commit 9d99499d.
- DONE: AC-2: status parity tests FAIL (not silently skip) when the Python oracle is absent — so a missing-oracle never masks a real divergence.
  Both oracle chokepoints (`harness_test.go` `oraclePath`/`runOracle`, independent `indOraclePath`) now resolve the tree-relative vendored oracle (`internal/status/vendor/status`, byte-identical to the plugin oracle) and `t.Fatalf` on a missing oracle — mirroring the dispatch `vendoredOracle`+`t.Fatalf` pattern. Demonstrated: oracle var UNSET → strongest parity tests RUN via vendored oracle (0 skips), pass; `SPACEDOCK_ORACLE` → missing path → parity tests FAIL. Commit 941fdcb3.
- DONE: ALSO (audit follow-up from zs #246): sweep the two now-stale comments in internal/dispatch/build.go.
  ABOUTME line 2 dropped the `(non-_mods)` qualifier; `runBuild` docstring now says it appends the show-standing fetch line when standing teammates exist and "Matches cmd_build" (zs #246 landed the `_mods/standing` branch). Commit 5fdb32f6.

### Summary

All four items landed behavior-preserving on branch `spacedock-ensign/architecture-review-cleanups` (4 commits: 924a588c, 941fdcb3, 9d99499d, 5fdb32f6). `go test ./...` 587 passed / 1 failed — the sole failure is the pre-existing env-gated `TestCodexResolveManifestAgainstInstalledHost` in untouched `internal/cli` (codex host config error, not code). `go test -race` on the touched packages 377 passed; `gofmt -l` clean; `go vet ./...` clean. Key decision for AC-2: rather than a CI-only env hard-fail, the oracle now resolves the always-present in-tree vendored copy, so the parity suite hard-fails on a real divergence everywhere (CI and fresh clones), not just where a laptop path happened to exist.

## Stage Report: validation

- DONE: AC-1: confirm pyJoin is SHARED (one definition, both call sites) across the internal/status <-> internal/dispatch seam, not byte-duplicated — read the source + confirm the suite green.
  Single definition `status.PyJoin` (`internal/status/mutate.go:263`); `internal/dispatch` consumes `status.PyJoin` at both seam call sites (`build.go:228,354`); the byte-identical dispatch copy is deleted (`git show 924a588c -- internal/dispatch/helpers.go` = -21 lines, `grep yJoin helpers.go` = 0). `go build ./...` clean.
- DONE: AC-3: the verified dead-code / test-hygiene items are removed and the full suite stays green.
  All six gone: `definitionDirSpelling`, `(*entity).get`, `runGit` passthrough (repointed caller to `runGitCmd`), `sortStrings` alias, both `_ = strings.TrimSpace` crutches, test `sdB32Alphabet` (now uses production `sdB32Chars`, `identity.go:18`). Retained `env.get`/`orderedMap.get` (distinct, still-used) survive. `go vet ./...` clean; `go test ./...` 587/1 (sole fail = pre-existing env-gated codex test).
- DONE: AC-2: status parity tests FAIL (not silently skip) when the Python oracle is absent — verify behaviorally.
  Both chokepoints `oraclePath`/`runOracle` (`harness_test.go:51`) and independent `indOraclePath` (`zz_independent_parity_test.go:30`) `t.Fatalf` on a missing oracle; no oracle-path `t.Skip` remains (only `vendor_runner_test.go:62` python3-availability skip, unrelated). Demo A: `SPACEDOCK_ORACLE` UNSET → strongest parity tests (`TestNativeReadMatchesOracle`, `TestNativeValidationParity`, `TestInd*`) RUN with 0 skips, all PASS via the in-tree vendored oracle (byte-identical to plugin source `skills/commission/bin/status` — same SHA a0c38dcd). Demo B: `SPACEDOCK_ORACLE=/tmp/no-such-oracle.py` → 94 `[FAIL]`, 0 `[SKIP]`, go test exit 1, 80 `does not exist` Fatalf lines. Pre-fix base `d91d1948` `oraclePath()` returned `""`→`t.Skip` on missing — confirming the fix is real, not a no-op.
- DONE: The two build.go comments (ABOUTME line 2; the runBuild docstring) now describe the code as-is — no staleness. go test green except the pre-existing env-gated codex test; gofmt/vet clean.
  ABOUTME line 2 dropped the `(non-_mods)` qualifier; `runBuild` docstring (`build.go:59-63`) now says it always emits show-stage-def and appends show-standing "when the workflow declares at least one standing teammate. Matches cmd_build" — accurate to the code (`build.go:384` gates on `EnumerateDeclaredStandingTeammates > 0`). No `non-_mods`/`deferred`/`claude-runtime-segregation`/`sibling` strings remain in build.go (`git show 5fdb32f6` removed the stale prose).

### Summary

PASSED. All three ACs plus the build.go comment-sweep item verified independently. AC-1/AC-3 are byte-level source confirmations + a green suite; AC-2 is verified behaviorally both directions (oracle-unset → 0 skips/all pass via the in-tree vendored oracle; oracle-missing → 94 fails/0 skips/exit 1) and the pre-fix base was confirmed to skip-on-missing, so the test-integrity fix is genuine. Gates: `go build` clean, `gofmt -l` clean, `go vet ./...` clean, `go test ./...` 587 passed / 1 failed (sole failure = pre-existing env-gated `TestCodexResolveManifestAgainstInstalledHost` in untouched `internal/cli`, a codex host-config error, named-acceptable in dispatch), `-race` on both touched packages clean (run per-package: dispatch 7.6s ok, status 13.9s ok — a combined `-race ./internal/status ./internal/dispatch` hit a transient host-disk "no space left on device" at ~273Mi free, an environment constraint, not a code/test failure). The changes are behavior-preserving; no adversarial audit required per the dispatch.
