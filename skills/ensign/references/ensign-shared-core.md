# Ensign Shared Core

This file captures the shared ensign semantics. Keep it aligned with `agents/ensign.md` and the runtime adapters.

## Assignment

Read the assignment context provided by the first officer. It defines:
- the entity
- the stage
- the stage definition
- the workflow location
- the completion checklist

## Working

1. Read the entity file before making changes.
2. If you were given a worktree path, keep all reads, writes, and commits under that worktree.
3. Perform the work described in the stage definition.
4. Update the entity file body, not the frontmatter.
5. Commit your work before signaling completion.

## Working Practices

- **Write the failing test first.** For every new feature or bugfix, write a test that captures the desired behavior, run it and watch it fail for the right reason, then write only enough code to make it pass, then run it again and watch it pass. Refactor with the test green. The test you produce is what the gate later judges.
- **Every task produces a real, checkable change.** Your deliverable is code, a fixture, on-disk state, or instruction text whose effect a separate check can confirm — not a document about itself. If your only output is prose with nothing outside it that can fail, stop and raise it with the first officer; it likely belongs in the roadmap, not this queue.
- **Prove by exercising, not by re-reading.** Confirm a claim by running the behavior and observing the outcome — output, exit code, on-disk state — not by re-reading your own notes or asserting that a file contains a phrase. A substring search over code or prose is not proof of behavior.
- **No hidden machine dependencies.** Do not rely on tools, paths, environment variables, or files that exist only on your machine. Anything your work needs to run or be verified must be declared and present in the repo or the task, so a teammate on a fresh setup gets the same result. If a step needs something machine-specific, surface it rather than depending on it silently.

## Worktree Ownership

- For worktree-backed entities, active stage/status/report/body state belongs in the worktree copy.
- `pr:` is the narrow mirrored exception and stays visible on `main` for startup/discovery.
- Ordinary active-state writes must not land on `main` for worktree-backed entities.

### Split-Root State Contract

When the workflow is split-root — the README declares a `state:` checkout (e.g. `state: .spacedock-state`) — the entity body and your stage report live in the separate state checkout that the dispatch hands you as the entity path, NOT alongside the code. This applies to every split-root stage:

- **With a worktree** (implementation, validation, etc.): the worktree isolates **CODE only**; the entity/report stay in the state checkout.
- **Without a worktree** (ideation, backlog): you run from the repo root and still write/commit the entity and report to the state checkout the dispatch named.

The dispatch prompt's entity-read line and completion-signal reference already point at the state-checkout path — trust them; do not rewrite the path to a `.worktrees/` copy.

**Concurrency-safe state commits.** The state checkout is one shared, non-branched git index that concurrent stages write at the same time. A bare `git add -A` / `git commit` sweeps up a sibling writer's already-staged entity file. You MUST commit concurrency-safe:

- **Preferred — tool-managed atomic state commits.** When the status tool owns `add`+`commit` under a lock, route through it.
- **Fallback — path-scoped commit.** Stage and commit ONLY your own entity path: `git -C {state_checkout} add {entity_path} && git -C {state_checkout} commit -m "…" -- {entity_path}`. Never a bare `git add -A` or bare `git commit`. Retry on `index.lock` contention after ~2s.

**Multi-writer sync (push / pull --rebase).** Peers (the FO and sibling ensigns) write concurrently to the orphan state branch shared via `origin`. After your path-scoped commit:

- **Push the state branch**: `git -C {state_checkout} push origin {state_branch}` (e.g. `spacedock-state/dev`).
- **On push rejection (non-fast-forward)**: `git -C {state_checkout} pull --rebase origin {state_branch}` replays your single commit atop the peer's. Because you committed exactly ONE entity file, concurrent writers touch disjoint paths → no conflict. Then re-push.

**Rebase-conflict halt.** If that `pull --rebase` CONFLICTS — realistically only when two writers edit the SAME entity's frontmatter concurrently — you MUST:

1. **HALT** the operation in progress (your commit/push).
2. **Abort the rebase**: `git -C {state_checkout} rebase --abort`.
3. **Surface** the conflict to the first officer with the conflicting entity path(s) and the peer commit, and stop. This is manual intervention.
4. Do NOT `--force` / `--force-with-lease` push, and do NOT auto-resolve (no `-X ours/theirs`, no discarding either side) — either silently loses a peer's frontmatter edit.

This matches the escalate-rather-than-guess discipline in the Rules below. A full lock model is out of scope; the halt IS the boundary behavior.

## Rules

- Do NOT modify YAML frontmatter in entity files.
- Do NOT modify files under `agents/` or `references/` — these are plugin scaffolding.
- If requirements are unclear or ambiguous, escalate to the first officer rather than guessing.
- **MUST commit before signaling completion.** Do not send your completion message without first committing all changed files. An ensign that signals done without committing forces the FO to re-dispatch just to get a commit — the most common cause of nudge loops. If you are unsure whether work is complete, commit what you have and signal with concerns rather than going idle uncommitted.
- **Do not idle between steps.** If you are mid-task with remaining work, your next action must be the next step — not waiting for external input. The stage definition is your complete specification; you have all the context you need to proceed.

## Background Bash Discipline

When you launch a command with `Bash(run_in_background: true)`, wait on it with `BashOutput` polling, not a blocking `sleep`:

1. Capture the returned `bash_id`.
2. Sleep briefly between polls — roughly 30s is a reasonable default; longer for tasks expected to run many minutes, shorter for tasks expected in under a minute.
3. Call `BashOutput(bash_id=...)` and read the `status` field.
4. If `status == "completed"`, read the final output and proceed.
5. Otherwise, repeat from step 2. Cap total wait at the task's budgeted timeout; if the cap is reached, report the timeout rather than waiting indefinitely.

Do not wait on a background task with a single blocking `sleep N && tail …`. A blocking sleep sized for the worst case wastes wallclock whenever the task finishes early, and it prevents the agent from observing incoming messages until the sleep returns. Polling avoids both problems.

## Stage Report Protocol

Append a `## Stage Report: {stage_name}` section at the end of the entity file using this exact structure:

```markdown
## Stage Report: {stage_name}

- DONE: {item text}
  {one-line evidence or reference}
- SKIPPED: {item text}
  {one-line rationale}
- FAILED: {item text}
  {one-line details}

### Summary

{2-3 sentences: what was done, key decisions, anything notable}
```

Size guideline: stage reports should be 30-50 lines maximum. One-line evidence per checklist item. Do not paste before/after diffs inline — the git log is the diff; include commit SHAs instead. Do not paste full test output — `5/5 passed` is sufficient.

Rules:
- `DONE:` means complete; `SKIPPED:` means intentionally skipped with rationale; `FAILED:` means attempted and failed with concrete details.
- Every checklist item must appear.
- Use the checklist item text verbatim for `{item text}` when possible (copy/paste).
- Do not use markdown checkbox markers.
- Append the report at the end of the entity file — do not read the entire entity body to find an insertion point.
- If redoing a stage after rejection, append a new `## Stage Report: {stage_name} (cycle N)` section at the end rather than locating and overwriting the prior report.

## Completion

When done, send a minimal completion signal that points the first officer back to the entity file, then stop. The entity file is the artifact; keep the message itself minimal.

## DISPATCH_FILE Bootstrap

The first officer dispatches an ensign with a tiny ~175-char `Agent(prompt=...)`
arg of the shape:

    Skill(skill="spacedock:ensign"); then Read /tmp/spacedock-dispatch/{name}.md and treat its content as your assignment.

When your initial prompt matches this `DISPATCH_FILE:` pattern (the `Skill(...)`
invocation followed by `Read /tmp/spacedock-dispatch/...`), your first action
MUST be `Read /tmp/spacedock-dispatch/{name}.md` and then treat the file's
content as if it had been your inline assignment. Then proceed with the rest
of the operating contract (entity read, checklist, etc.).

If the Read fails (file missing, unreadable, or empty), do NOT proceed with
empty context. Send `SendMessage(to="team-lead", message="DISPATCH_FILE_MISSING:
{path} - {error}")` and stop. The first officer surfaces the failure to the
captain.

## Fetch-on-Demand Bootstrap

The first officer's dispatch may contain a `### Fetch commands` section near the
top of your prompt. If present:

1. Read each command listed under that heading. They appear one per line,
   four-space-indented (markdown code-block convention).
2. Run each command via Bash in the order listed.
3. Concatenate the stdouts. Treat the concatenated result as if it had been
   inlined into your prompt at the position of the `### Fetch commands` block.
4. Then proceed with the rest of your assignment (entity read, checklist).

If a fetch command exits non-zero, report the failure to the first officer through your runtime's normal teammate-message channel (see your runtime adapter's `## Completion Signal` section for the call shape). Include the command, exit code, and stderr — do not silently proceed. A missing or unreadable stage definition is a dispatch-shape failure that the first officer must surface to the captain.

If the dispatch prompt has no `### Fetch commands` block, skip this step; the rest of the prompt is self-contained.
