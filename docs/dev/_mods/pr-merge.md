# PR Merge

Manages the PR lifecycle for workflow entities processed in worktree stages of this **split-root** workflow. The CODE for an entity lives on its worktree branch in the main repo (`origin`, base branch resolved from the workflow's `trunk:` config, default `main`); the entity STATE (frontmatter, `pr:`, `mod-block:`, stage reports) lives in the separate `.spacedock-state` checkout (`origin`, branch `spacedock-state/dev`). This hook opens a PR for the code branch at the terminal merge boundary — **before** cleanup deletes the branch — records `pr:` on the entity state, blocks until the PR merges, then lets the FO terminalize and archive.

The terminal merge ceremony keys off the pending terminal-target application that `spacedock gate consume` produces (route `approved-awaiting-merge`) — not off the entity's stage: `merge guard` discovers and arms this hook at delivery time, and a failed delivery that needs rework sends the entity back through its declared `feedback-to` via `merge guard --rework`.

The two origins stay clean by construction: the code PR carries only the code-branch range (the worktree clone has no `.spacedock-state` paths), and the `pr:`/`mod-block:` writes are `spacedock status --set` against the state checkout, committed path-scoped there. **This hook MUST NOT touch `.spacedock-state` from the code worktree** — all state writes go through `spacedock status --set --workflow-dir docs/dev`, which targets the resolved state checkout.

## Hook: startup

Scan all entity files (in the workflow directory only, not `_archive/`) for entities with a non-empty `pr` field and either non-terminal status, terminal status with `mod-block: merge:pr-merge`, or terminal status carrying a valid merged sentinel (`pr-merge:` or `local-merge:`). A sentinel row already proves MERGED: bypass `gh`, run `spacedock merge guard {slug} --workflow-dir docs/dev --verdict passed` directly, and stop processing that row. For every bare PR row, extract the PR number (strip any `#`, `owner/repo#` prefix) and check: `gh pr view {number} --json state --jq '.state'`.

If `MERGED`, advance the entity to its terminal stage by delegating the finalize to the `merge guard` verb — the same verb the FO drives at the merge boundary, so the mod's finalize path and the verb's are one shipped path:
1. Record the landed merge as the `pr-merge` sentinel so the verb keys off a signal that honestly says "this PR merged" rather than the bare `#{N}` open-PR reference: `spacedock status --workflow-dir docs/dev --set {slug} pr=pr-merge:{N}` (commit: `pr: {slug} pr-merge:{N} merged`).
2. Finalize through the verb: `spacedock merge guard {slug} --workflow-dir docs/dev --verdict passed`. The verb clears the in-flight `mod-block` (standalone `--set`), terminalizes (`status`+`verdict=passed`+`completed` in one `--set`), archives, commits path-scoped, and publishes through shared state-sync discipline — atomically through the commit boundary. It refuses to combine the `mod-block=` clear with the terminal fields (the same two-step the FO relies on), so the ceremony integrity holds.
The sentinel `--set` is committed path-scoped to the state checkout; the verb owns its own commits. Remove the worktree (`git worktree remove {path}`) and delete the **local** branch (`git branch -d {branch}`) — the remote branch was already cleaned by the PR merge. Report each auto-advanced entity to the captain. (The `pr` field now records the `pr-merge:{N}` sentinel post-finalize, where it was a bare `#{N}` before — the only state-recording delta; the lifecycle behavior, terminal+archived, is identical.)

If `CLOSED` (closed without merge), report to the captain: "{entity title} has PR {pr number} which was closed without merging. How to proceed? Options: reopen the PR, create a new PR from the same branch, fall back to the local `--no-ff` merge, or send the entity back for rework." Wait for the captain's direction before taking action. On captain direction to send back: `spacedock merge guard {slug} --rework --workflow-dir docs/dev` routes the entity through its declared `feedback-to` and clears `pr`/`mod-block` — do not edit frontmatter by hand. Retryable trouble (reopen, new PR, local merge) keeps the pending approval and the delivery retry; only `--rework` supersedes it.

If `OPEN`, no action needed — the PR is still in review.

If `gh` is not available, warn the captain and skip PR state checks.

## Hook: idle

Check PR-pending entities using the same logic as the startup hook: a terminal row carrying a valid merged sentinel (`pr-merge:` or `local-merge:`) bypasses `gh` and resumes `merge guard` directly, while bare PR rows (including terminal rows still carrying `mod-block: merge:pr-merge`) run `gh pr view` and advance through the same committed sentinel then guard path. This provides a periodic re-check in case the event loop's built-in PR scan missed a state change (defense in depth). Report any advanced entities to the captain.

## Hook: merge

Runs at the terminal merge boundary, before any local merge or cleanup, for the entity's CODE worktree branch `{branch}` (the branch named in the entity's `worktree:` field, located at `{worktree}`).

Resolve the PR base once: `BASE=$(spacedock dispatch trunk --workflow-dir docs/dev)` — the workflow's configured integration trunk (default `main`). `dispatch trunk` emits exactly a **bare branch name** (e.g. `main`), so `$( )` yields `$BASE` clean (command substitution strips the single trailing newline). Always quote `"$BASE"` at use sites. Use `"$BASE"` for the draft, the diff stat, the `gh pr create --base`, and the fallback merge target below.

**PR APPROVAL GUARDRAIL — Do NOT push or create a PR without explicit captain approval.** Opening a PR and pushing the branch are outward-facing. Before presenting the draft, construct the full PR body so the captain reviews the actual prose that will land on GitHub.

Compute the audit-link inputs first: state SHA via `git -C docs/dev/.spacedock-state rev-parse HEAD` (the full SHA of the **state** checkout's HEAD — the entity's `mod-block=merge:pr-merge` commit, which the FO committed before invoking this hook, so HEAD already contains the active entity file); owner/repo via `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner'`; short entity-id slot via `spacedock status --workflow-dir docs/dev --short-id {slug}` (shortest-unique-prefix for sd-b32 workflows, matching the status table's ID column).

Build the full PR body using the template below — motivation lead, `## What changed`, `## Evidence`, `---` separator, `[{short-id}](...)` audit link, and `Closes {issue}` line if the entity frontmatter `issue` is set. This is the body that will be passed to `gh pr create` verbatim; do not reconstruct it after approval. The entity body and stage reports are read from the **state checkout** (`docs/dev/.spacedock-state/{slug}/index.md`), not the worktree.

Then present the draft to the captain:

- **Title:** {entity title}
- **Branch:** {branch} -> $BASE
- **Changes:** {N} file(s) changed across {N} commit(s) (`git -C {worktree} diff --stat origin/$BASE...{branch}`)
- **Files:** {list of changed files}
- **Body:**

  ```
  {constructed body}
  ```

Wait for the captain's explicit approval before pushing. Do NOT infer approval from silence, acknowledgment of the summary, or the gate approval that preceded this step — only an explicit "push it", "go ahead", "yes", or equivalent counts.

**On approval:** This is a split-root workflow — the FO rebases the code branch onto `origin/$BASE` BEFORE invoking this hook, and the entity state lives in the separate `.spacedock-state` checkout, so this hook does NOT rebase or push any state branch. Push only the code branch:

1. `git -C {worktree} push -u origin {branch}` — push the entity's code branch to the code remote (`origin` = the main repo, base branch `$BASE`). Do NOT push the trunk or any `.spacedock-state` branch from here; the FO coordinates state-remote pushes separately.

If the push fails (no remote, auth error), report to the captain and fall back to the local `--no-ff` merge (see fallback below).

2. Create the PR: `gh pr create --base "$BASE" --head {branch} --title "{entity title}" --body "{constructed body}"` against the body already constructed above — do not rebuild it. Capture the PR number `{N}`.

3. Record it on the entity STATE: `spacedock status --workflow-dir docs/dev --set {slug} pr=#{N}`. This writes `pr:` into the state-checkout entity frontmatter; the FO commits it path-scoped to `.spacedock-state` (`git -C docs/dev/.spacedock-state add -- {slug}/index.md && git -C docs/dev/.spacedock-state commit -m "pr: {slug} #{N} pending" -- {slug}/index.md`) and pushes `spacedock-state/dev` so the PR-pending state survives session resume and is visible on a 2nd host.

Setting `pr:` is the **blocking** signal (FO Merge-and-Cleanup step 3a). The FO set `mod-block=merge:pr-merge` before invoking this hook; with `pr:` now set the hook has blocked, so the FO leaves `mod-block` set, reports PR-pending to the captain, and does NOT local-merge or archive. The entity stays at its current stage with `pr` set until the PR merges. The FO advances to the terminal stage and archives when it detects the merge (via the event-loop PR check, the idle hook, or the startup hook) — see those hooks for the sentinel-record-then-`merge guard` finalize.

### PR body template

Lead with motivation + end-user value; audit metadata goes at the bottom. The goal is that a reviewer or future debugger sees the "why" first and the audit link last.

**Template structure (top to bottom):**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Motivation lead | **yes** | 1 sentence, ≤ 25 words, blending motivation and end-user value. No parentheticals. |
| `## What changed` | **yes** | Action-verb bullets, 3–5 total, each ≤ 15 words. One change per bullet. No rationale inside the bullet — if a change needs justification, it belongs in the task body, not the PR. |
| `## Evidence` | **yes when validation ran** | Test suites with `N/N passed` format, 1–2 bullets. Do not include per-test-class breakdowns or enumerated suite lists — one pass ratio per suite, plus at most one line confirming live-probe verification. |
| `## Review guidance` | optional | 1 line pointing reviewer at the critical file or risky change — include only when a stage report explicitly flagged it |
| `---` separator + `[{entity-id}](/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{state-sha}/{state-relative-path})` | **yes** | Audit link, at the bottom. `{state-sha}` is the full SHA of the state checkout's HEAD (see merge-hook step); `{state-relative-path}` is the entity file's active `.spacedock-state`-relative location (`{slug}/index.md`). An immutable state-commit SHA — NOT a branch ref — so the link still resolves after the entity archives. |
| `Closes {issue}` | **yes when issue set** | Under the audit link, using the value exactly as it appears in frontmatter, e.g., `#48` or `owner/repo#48` |
| `Related: {siblings}` | optional | Under Closes, only when stage reports flagged follow-ups |

**Extraction rules (apply deterministically from the entity file):**

| PR body section | Source in entity file | Transformation |
|---|---|---|
| Motivation lead | Entity body paragraph(s) between closing `---` and the first `##` heading | Condense first paragraph to 1-2 sentences. Lead with impact or action verb — not "This PR" or "This task". Blend motivation + value. |
| What changed | Implementation stage report's DONE items | One action-verb bullet per meaningful unit. Collapse sibling bullets that describe the same thing. Do NOT include "what we deliberately did NOT change" bullets — scope boundaries belong in the task body, not the PR, unless a validation stage report flagged them as risk. |
| Evidence | Validation stage report items that assert AC verification (typically rerun-test items) | One bullet per suite with `N/N passed` format. Include any quantitative result the stage report explicitly called out (wallclock delta, size %, perf). Fallback to implementation report's self-test items if no validation stage exists. |
| Review guidance | Explicit "focus on X" / "risk here" notes in either stage report | 1 line. **Omit if no such note exists.** |
| Audit link | Short entity id from `spacedock status --workflow-dir docs/dev --short-id {slug}`, active path from the entity file's `.spacedock-state`-relative location (`{slug}/index.md`), state SHA from `git -C docs/dev/.spacedock-state rev-parse HEAD` (the STATE checkout's HEAD — NOT the code worktree, NOT a branch ref) | Format as `[{short-id}](/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{state-sha}/{state-relative-path})` |
| Closes | Entity frontmatter `issue` field (exactly as written) | Prefix `Closes ` |
| Related | Explicit "related task" / "follow-up" mentions in stage reports | 1 line. **Omit if none.** |

Target total length: **60-120 words**.

### Fallback: no PR host available

If `gh` is not on PATH, or `gh pr create` fails, or the branch push fails, no remote PR is opened. Report to the captain that no PR could be opened and fall back to the FO's default local merge (Merge-and-Cleanup step 6): a local `--no-ff` merge of the code branch `{branch}` from the worktree onto `$BASE`. The merge-hook guard refuses terminalizing while `pr` and `mod-block` are both empty and a merge hook is registered (it checks the *post-update* state, not the order in which `mod-block` was cleared), so the no-PR path must leave the guard a truthful signal that a merge ran. Two paths satisfy it without `--force`:

- **Workflow declares `merge: local`:** the policy exempts the pr-requirement of the merge-hook guard. The FO clears the `mod-block` it set before invoking (its own standalone `spacedock status --workflow-dir docs/dev --set {slug} mod-block=`, committed path-scoped), then terminalizes and archives — no sentinel needed, no `--force`.
- **Workflow has NOT declared `merge: local`:** record the landed merge with the `local-merge` sentinel. After the local `--no-ff` merge lands, compute the merge-commit SHA on `$BASE` and set it as the `pr`: `spacedock status --workflow-dir docs/dev --set {slug} pr=local-merge:{short-sha}` (committed path-scoped). The guard then sees a non-empty `pr` and is satisfied honestly — `pr` truthfully records that a merge shipped, just not a remote PR, and the status table renders it as `{short-sha} (local)`. Set the sentinel **only after the merge has truly landed** (the SHA must already exist on `$BASE`); a sentinel set before the merge would satisfy the guard with a signal that does not yet correspond to a commit. The corrected order is: invoke the hook → local merge lands → set the sentinel → clear `mod-block` → terminalize.

**On captain decline (PR host present, captain says no):** Do NOT automatically fall back to local merge. Ask the captain how to proceed — options include the local `--no-ff` merge or leaving the branch unmerged. Only act on the captain's explicit choice.
